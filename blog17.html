        Since the birth of the United Nations, the goals of multilateral disarmament and arms limitation have been central to the Organization’s efforts to maintain international peace and security.

        The UN has given highest priority to reducing and eventually eliminating nuclear weapons, destroying chemical weapons, and strengthening the prohibition of biological weapons – all of which pose the direst threats to humankind.
        
        While these objectives have remained constant over the years, the scope of deliberations and negotiations has changed as political realities and the international situation has evolved.
        
        The international community continues to consider more closely the excessive and destabilizing proliferation of small arms and light weapons and has mobilized to combat the massive deployment of landmines – instruments that threaten the economic and social fabric of societies and kill and maim civilians, all too many of whom are women and children. There is also wider recognition that all types of weapons impact women, men, boys and girls differently.
        
        The UN is also focusing on the impact of new information, telecommunications technologies and other emerging technologies on international security.
        
        Through global efforts, several multilateral treaties and instruments have been established with the aim of regulating, restricting, or eliminating certain weapons. These include the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the Biological and Chemical Weapons Convention, the Anti-Personnel Landmine Convention, the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and the Arms Trade Treaty.

    <h3 id="right-align-h-2">Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-2">
        Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous weapons on earth. One can destroy a whole city, potentially killing millions, and jeopardizing the natural environment and lives of future generations through its long-term catastrophic effects. The dangers from such weapons arise from their very existence. 

        Although nuclear weapons have only been used twice in warfare, about 13,080 reportedly remain in our world today and there have been over 2,000 nuclear tests conducted to date. Disarmament is the best protection against such dangers but achieving this goal has been a tremendously difficult challenge.
        
        The UN has sought to eliminate such weapons ever since its establishment. The first resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1946 established a Commission to deal with problems related to the discovery of atomic energy among others. The Commission was to make proposals for, inter alia, the control of atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes.
        
        Several multilateral treaties have since been established with the aim of preventing nuclear proliferation and testing, while promoting progress in nuclear disarmament.
        
        These include the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests In The Atmosphere, In Outer Space And Under Water, also known as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was signed in 1996 but has yet to enter into force, and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).

    <h3 id="left-align-h-3">Missiles</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-3">
        Missiles continue to be a focus of increased international attention, discussion, and activity. Their potential to carry and deliver weapons of mass destruction (WMD) payload quickly and accurately makes missiles a qualitatively significant political and military issue. In addition, the diversity of international views on matters related to missiles poses a particular challenge for efforts to address the issue in multilateral fora.

        Currently, there is no legally binding multilateral instrument dealing with the issue of missiles.
        
        Pursuant to General Assembly resolutions, three Panels of Government Experts devoted to the issue of missiles have been established within the United Nations. Presently, several other multilateral regimes exist which seek to prevent the proliferation of missiles and related technology. These include, notably, the Hague Code of Conduct (HCOC) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).

    <h3 id="right-align-h-4">Biological Weapons</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-4">
        The international taboo against biological weapons grew out of the horrors of the First World War. Their use has long been established as contrary to the laws of humanity and the dictates of public conscience.

        Biological weapons disseminate disease-causing organisms or toxins to harm or kill humans, animals, or plants. They can be deadly and highly contagious. Diseases caused by such weapons would not confine themselves to national borders and could spread rapidly around the world.
        
        The consequences of the deliberate release of biological agents or toxins by state or non-state actors could be dramatic. In addition to the tragic loss of lives, such events could cause food shortages, environmental catastrophes, devastating economic loss, and widespread illness, fear, and mistrust among the public.
        
        Long-sought efforts to globally eliminate these weapons of mass destruction finally came to fruition with the conclusion in 1972 of the Biological Weapons Convention.
        
        The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons. It was the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning an entire category of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

    <h3 id="left-align-h-4">Chemical Weapons</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-4">
        The modern use of chemical weapons began with World War I, when both sides to the conflict used poisonous gas to inflict agonizing suffering and to cause significant battlefield casualties.

        Such weapons basically consisted of well-known commercial chemicals put into standard munitions such as grenades and artillery shells. Chlorine, phosgene (a choking agent) and mustard gas were among the chemicals used.
        
        The results were indiscriminate and often devastating. Nearly 100,000 deaths resulted. Since World War I, chemical weapons have caused more than one million casualties globally.
        
        Long-sought efforts to globally eliminate these weapons of mass destruction finally came to fruition with the conclusion in 1993 of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
        
        The Convention aims to eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction by prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons; to prevent their re-emergence; to ensure the elimination of existing stocks of such weapons; and, in so doing, to make the world safe from the threat of chemical warfare.

    <h3 id="right-align-h-5">Conventional Weapons</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-5">
        Conventional arms are weapons other than weapons of mass destruction. They are the most commonly known and widely used weapons in conflict and crime settings and encompass a wide range of equipment, including battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, large-caliber artillery systems, combat aircraft and  uncrewed combat aerial vehicles (UCAV), attack helicopters, warships, missile and missile launchers, landmines, cluster munitions, small arms, and lights weapons and ammunition.

        The UN Charter does not forbid its Member States to own and use conventional arms when this is done in conformity with international law. This is the reason why the terms “arms control” and “arms limitations” are more often used than “disarmament” when referring to conventional arms.
        
        Some conventional weapons, however, may cause humanitarian concern either because of the way they are used or may be used, or because of their design which makes them incompatible with international humanitarian law.
        
        Early efforts to address such concerns were made already in the 19th century. A more recent example of legally binding regulations and limitations in the use of conventional weapons is the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons.
        
        The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) is a key instrument of international humanitarian law and, with its five Protocols, seeks to ban or restrict the use of specific types of weapons (non-detectable fragments; mines, booby-traps and other devices; incendiary weapons; blinding laser weapons and explosive remnants of war) that have indiscriminate effects on civilians or cause unnecessary suffering for combatants.

    <p id="left-align-p-6">
        Every day, people die or lose limbs from stepping on a landmine (anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines). Mostly in countries at peace – and the majority of victims are civilians.

        The Anti-personnel Landmine Convention, adopted in 1997, addresses this scourge. It bans the stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel landmines, requires countries to clear them on their territory, while prescribing States in a position to do so to assist affected countries.
        
        More than 160 countries have joined this treaty. Its positive impact includes a marked reduction of casualties, an increased number of mine-free States, destroyed stockpiles and improved assistance to victims.

        Climate change has adversely affected both terrestrial[76] and marine[77] ecosystems, and is expected to further
        affect many ecosystems, including tundra, mangroves, coral reefs, caves etc.[78] Increasing global temperature,
        more frequent occurrence of extreme weather, and rising sea level are among some of the effects of climate
        change that will have the most significant impact.[79][80] Some of the possible consequences of these effects
        include species decline and extinction, change within ecosystems, increased prevalence of invasive species, a
        shift from forests being carbon sinks to carbon sources, ocean acidification, disruption of the water cycle, and
        increased occurrence of natural disasters, among others

        Alpine flora at Logan Pass, Glacier National Park, in Montana, United States: Alpine plants are one group
        expected to be highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change
        Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local,
        regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the
        term.[81] Climate change is any significant long term change in the expected pattern, whether due to natural
        variability or as a result of human activity. Predicting the effects that climate change will have on plant
        biodiversity can be achieved using various models, however bioclimatic models are most commonly used.[82]
        Environmental conditions play a key role in defining the function and geographic distributions of plants, in
        combination with other factors, thereby modifying patterns of biodiversity.[83] Changes in long term
        environmental conditions that can be collectively coined climate change are known to have had enormous impacts
        on current plant diversity patterns; further impacts are expected in the future.[84] It is predicted that
        climate change will remain one of the major drivers of biodiversity patterns in the future.[85][86][87] Human
        actions are currently triggering the sixth major mass extinction our Earth has seen, changing the distribution
        and abundance of many plants.[88] A 2022 evaluation of vascular plant species suggests that species with no
        major uses in human society are much more likely to go extinct compared to plants actively cultivated for human
        purposes such as agriculture or urban decoration.[89]
        In addition, Pre-species barriers for plants are also the indirect effects of climate change due to human
        activities. First, as mentioned above, the reduction in the number of birds and insects used to help pollinate
        plants[90][91] will reduce the chance of mating between plants. Second, extended fire weather seasons may result
        in more severe burn conditions and shorter burn intervals, which can threaten the biodiversity of native
        vegetation.[92] Besides, species habitat changes or migrations under changing weather conditions can cause
        non-native plants[93] and pest to cause damage to native vegetation diversity, making them less structurally
        functional and more vulnerable to external damage,[94] which would all eventually lead to biodiversity loss.
        Plant and animal populations are interconnected. There are a number of examples in nature that display this
        dependency. Consider pollinator reliant plant species that display an observable sensitivity to pollinator
        activity.[95] A 2007 study looked into the relationship between plant diversity and phenology, experimentally
        determining that plant diversity influenced the broader community flowering time.[95] Flowering time is
        important piece in the pollination puzzle as it impacts the food supply for pollinators.[96] This in turn can
        play a major role in agricultural pursuits [96] and global food security.[97]
        While plants are essential for human survival, they have not received the same attention as the subject of
        conservation efforts as animals.[98] It's estimated that a third of all land plant species are at risk of
        extinction and 94% have yet to be evaluated in terms of their conservation status.[98]Plants existing at the
        lowest trophic level shows a need for an active effort for plant conservation as this will cause all higher
        levels to reduce in biodiversity in tandem with the reduction of plant biodiversity.[99]

        DPSIR: drivers, pressures, state, impact and response model of intervention
        Major factors for biotic stress and the ensuing accelerating loss rate are, amongst other threats:[102]
        1. Habitat loss and degradation
        Land use intensification (and ensuing land loss/habitat loss) has been identified to be a significant factor in
        loss of ecological services due to direct effects as well as biodiversity loss.[103]
        2. Climate change through heat stress and drought stress
        3. Excessive nutrient load and other forms of pollution
        4. Over-exploitation and unsustainable use (e.g. unsustainable fishing methods) we are currently using 25% more
        natural resources than the planet[clarification needed]
        5. Armed conflict, which disrupts human livelihoods and institutions, contributes to habitat loss, and
        intensifies over-exploitation of economically valuable species, leading to population declines and local
        extinctions.[104]
        6. Invasive alien species that effectively compete for a niche, replacing indigenous species[105]
        7. Drastic increases in the human population have greatly affected the Earth's ability to provide adequate
        resources for all forms of life.[106] Recent IUCN Red List reports indicate that 41% of amphibians, 14% of
        birds, and 26% of mammal species are currently threatened with extinction.[17]
        8. Habitat fragmentation for commercial and agricultural uses (specifically monoculture farming).[107]

        Demonstrator against biodiversity loss, at Extinction Rebellion (2018).
        You know, when we first set up WWF, our objective was to save endangered species from extinction. But we have
        failed completely; we haven't managed to save a single one. If only we had put all that money into condoms, we
        might have done some good.
        — Sir Peter Scott, Founder of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Cosmos Magazine, 2010[6]
        The current rate of global diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally
        occurring) background extinction rate, faster than at any other time in human history,[7][8] and expected to
        still grow in the upcoming years.[9][10][11] These rapidly rising extinction trends impacting numerous animal
        groups including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and ray-finned fishes have prompted scientists to declare
        a contemporary biodiversity crisis.[12]
        Locally bounded loss rates can be measured using species richness and its variation over time. Raw counts may
        not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute[clarification needed] abundances. Taking into account
        the relative frequencies, many biodiversity indexes have been developed. Besides richness, evenness and
        heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.[4]
        As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the
        observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity of the subject increases and the
        associated spatial and temporal scales widen."[13] Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split
        up into various scales (e.g. ecosystem diversity vs. habitat diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat
        diversity[13]) or different subcategories (e.g. phylogenetic diversity, species diversity, genetic diversity,
        nucleotide diversity). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer
        observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.[14][15]
        To compare rates between different geographic regions, latitudinal gradients in species diversity should also be
        considered.
        In 2006, many more species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists
        have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized.[16]
        In 2021, about 28 percent of the 134,400 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as
        threatened with extinction—a total of 37,400 species compared to 16,119 threatened species in 2006.[17]
        A 2022 study published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, which surveyed more than 3,000 experts,
        states that "global biodiversity loss and its impacts may be greater than previously thought," and estimates
        that roughly 30% of species "have been globally threatened or driven extinct since the year 1500."[18][19]

        Phenomenon
        In 2017, various publications described the dramatic reduction in absolute insect biomass and number of species
        in Germany and North America over a period of 27 years.[108][109] As possible reasons for the decline, the
        authors highlight neonicotinoids and other agrochemicals. Writing in the journal PLOS One, Hallman et al. (2017)
        conclude that "the widespread insect biomass decline is alarming."[110]
        For example, the critical decline of earthworms (over 80% on average) has been recorded under non-ecological
        agricultural practices.[111] Earthworms play an important role in ecosystem function.[111] For example, they
        help with biological processing in soil, water, and even green house gas balancing.[112] The decline of
        earthworm populations are said to be due to five reasons; soil degradation and destruction of habitat, climate
        change, biological invasion of nonnative species, poor soil management, and pollutant loading.[113] Factors like
        tillage practices and intensive land use decimate the soil and plant roots that earthworms use to create their
        biomass, causing carbon and nitrogen cycles to be impacted negatively. Knowledge of earthworm species diversity
        is quite limited as not even 50% of them have been described. More studies upon earthworms and how they provide
        their ecosystem services must be done to gain a better understanding of going about preserving their
        diversity.[113] With earthworm populations dwindling, this has caused for the Secretariat of the Convention on
        Biological Diversity to take action and promote the restoration and maintenance of the many diverse species of
        earthworms.[113]

        Demonstrator against biodiversity loss, at Extinction Rebellion (2018).
        You know, when we first set up WWF, our objective was to save endangered species from extinction. But we have
        failed completely; we haven't managed to save a single one. If only we had put all that money into condoms, we
        might have done some good.
        — Sir Peter Scott, Founder of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Cosmos Magazine, 2010[6]
        The current rate of global diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally
        occurring) background extinction rate, faster than at any other time in human history,[7][8] and expected to
        still grow in the upcoming years.[9][10][11] These rapidly rising extinction trends impacting numerous animal
        groups including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and ray-finned fishes have prompted scientists to declare
        a contemporary biodiversity crisis.[12]
        Locally bounded loss rates can be measured using species richness and its variation over time. Raw counts may
        not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute[clarification needed] abundances. Taking into account
        the relative frequencies, many biodiversity indexes have been developed. Besides richness, evenness and
        heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.[4]
        As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the
        observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity of the subject increases and the
        associated spatial and temporal scales widen."[13] Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split
        up into various scales (e.g. ecosystem diversity vs. habitat diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat
        diversity[13]) or different subcategories (e.g. phylogenetic diversity, species diversity, genetic diversity,
        nucleotide diversity). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer
        observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.[14][15]
        To compare rates between different geographic regions, latitudinal gradients in species diversity should also be
        considered.
        In 2006, many more species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists
        have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized.[16]
        In 2021, about 28 percent of the 134,400 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as
        threatened with extinction—a total of 37,400 species compared to 16,119 threatened species in 2006.[17]
        A 2022 study published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, which surveyed more than 3,000 experts,
        states that "global biodiversity loss and its impacts may be greater than previously thought," and estimates
        that roughly 30% of species "have been globally threatened or driven extinct since the year 1500."[18][19]

        Certain types of pesticide, neonicotinoids, probably contribute to the decline of certain bird species.[114] A
        study funded by BirdLife International confirms that 51 species of birds are critically endangered and 8 could
        be classified as extinct or in danger of extinction. Nearly 30% of extinction is due to hunting and trapping for
        the exotic pet trade. Deforestation, caused by unsustainable logging and agriculture, could be the next
        extinction driver, because birds lose their habitat and their food. The biologist Luisa Arnedo said: "as soon as
        the habitat is gone, they're gone too".[115]
        Within the Amazon rainforest there is an area called Bele´m and it is an area of endemism. In Bele´m 76% of the
        land has already been stripped of its natural resources, including the trees of the forest.[116] Within the area
        bird species are strongly affected by the deforestation, due to being put in that situation 56% of the birds are
        now in danger of going into extinction. With the climate changing as well as their habitat, the population of
        the birds will continue to decline. Even with protected areas of land, the efficiency in which birds are
        conserved are low.[116]
        Modern bird hunting and trapping is a common practice in South America. Some cultures in Brazil encourage bird
        hunting and trapping for commercial reasons. Some reasons include, selling the wild birds as pets, breeding the
        birds and selling the young, selling the birds for food, and selling them for religious and medicinal
        purposes.[117]
        Another increasingly abundant threat to bird populations is collisions and electrocutions due to power
        lines.[118] Migratory species are at a higher risk of collision accidents and up to 1 billion birds are killed
        due to colliding with buildings each year in the United States.[119]

        Freshwater ecosystems ranging from swamps, deltas, to rivers make up to 1% of earths surface. Although making up
        such little proportion of the earth, freshwater ecosystems are important because these kind of habitats are home
        to approximately one third of vertebrate species.[120] Freshwater species are beginning to decline at twice the
        rate of other species such as those located on land or within the ocean, this rapid loss has already placed 27%
        of 29,500 species dependent on freshwater upon the IUCN Red List.[120] With freshwater species declining so
        quickly, it is due to the poor systems in place that don't provide any protection to their biodiversity.
        A study by 16 global conservation organizations found that the biodiversity crisis is most acute in freshwater
        ecosystems, with a rate of decline double that of oceans and forests. Global populations of freshwater fish are
        collapsing from anthropogenic impacts such as pollution and overfishing. Migratory fish populations have
        declined by 76% since 1970, and large "megafish" populations have fallen by 94% with 16 species declared extinct
        in 2020.[121]

        Humans have altered plant richness in regional landscapes worldwide, transforming more than 75% of the
        terrestrial biomes to "anthropogenic biomes." This is seen through loss of native species being replaced and out
        competed by agriculture. Models indicate that about half of the biosphere has seen a "substantial net
        anthropogenic change" in species richness.[122]

        Marine biodiversity encompasses any living organism which resides in the ocean, and describes various complex
        relationships within marine ecosystems.[68] On a local and regional scale, marine communities are better
        understood compared to marine ecosystems on a global scale. In 2018, it was estimated that approximately 240,000
        marine species have been documented.[67] Based on this prediction, the discovery of total marine species ranges
        between 11% to 78% due to uncertainties regarding global marine biodiversity.[67] However, the number of
        described marine species remains low compared to terrestrial species due to various factors, which includes the
        assignment of different names for the same species, and insufficient taxa classification.[68] It is likely that
        many undocumented species have already disappeared. Because not all marine species have been described, it is
        difficult to provide an accurate estimate of global extinction in marine ecosystems. As a result, abundances of
        marine species remain uncertain, with estimates ranging between 178,000 and 10 million oceanic species.[68]
        With anthropogenic pressure, this results in human activities having the strongest influences on marine
        biodiversity, with main drivers of global extinction being habitat loss, pollution, invasive species, and
        overexploitation.[123][124] Greater pressure is placed on marine ecosystems with human settlements near coastal
        areas.[125] Other indirect factors that have resulted in marine species to decline include climate change and
        change to oceanic biochemistry.[123]
        Overexploitation has resulted in the extinction of over 20 described marine species, which includes seabirds,
        marine mammals, algae, and fishes.[68] Examples of extinct marine species include the Steller's sea cow
        (Hydrodamalis gigas) and the Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis). However, not all extinctions are because
        of humans. For example, in 1930, the eelgrass limpet (Lottia alveus) became extinct once the Zostera marina
        seagrass population declined upon exposure to a disease. The Lottia alveus were greatly impacted as the Zostera
        marina were their sole habitats.[68]

        Biodiversity loss also threatens the structure and proper functioning of the ecosystem. Although all ecosystems
        are able to adapt to the stresses associated with reductions in biodiversity to some degree, biodiversity loss
        reduces an ecosystem's complexity, as roles once played by multiple interacting species or multiple interacting
        individuals are played by fewer or none.[42] The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the
        mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and
        pathways of potential community change. At higher levels of extinction (40 to 60 percent of species), the
        effects of species loss ranked with those of many other major drivers of environmental change, such as ozone
        pollution, acid deposition on forests and nutrient pollution.[126] Finally, the effects are also seen on human
        needs such as clean water, air and food production over-time. For example, studies over the last two
        decades[when?] have demonstrated that more biologically diverse ecosystems are more productive.[127] As a
        result, there has been growing concern that the very high rates of modern extinctions – due to habitat loss,
        overharvesting and other human-caused environmental changes – could reduce nature's ability to provide goods and
        services like food, clean water and a stable climate.[128]
        An October 2020 analysis by Swiss Re found that one-fifth of all countries are at risk of ecosystem collapse as
        the result of anthropogenic habitat destruction and increased wildlife loss.[129]

        An infographic describing the relationship between biodiversity and food.
        In 2019, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization produced its first report on The State of the World's
        Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, which warned that "Many key components of biodiversity for food and
        agriculture at genetic, species and ecosystem levels are in decline."[130][131] The report states that this is
        being caused by "a variety of drivers operating at a range of levels" and more specifically that "major global
        trends such as changes in climate, international markets and demography give rise to more immediate drivers such
        as land-use change, pollution and overuse of external inputs, overharvesting and the proliferation of invasive
        species. Interactions between drivers often exacerbate their effects on biodiversity for food and agriculture
        (BFA). Demographic changes, urbanization, markets, trade and consumer preferences are reported [by the countries
        that provided inputs to the report] to have a strong influence on food systems, frequently with negative
        consequences for BFA and the ecosystem services it provides. However, such drivers are also reported to open
        opportunities to make food systems more sustainable, for example through the development of markets for
        biodiversity-friendly products."[132] It further states that "the driver mentioned by the highest number of
        countries as having negative effects on regulating and supporting ecosystem services [in food and agricultural
        production systems] is changes in land and water use and management" and that "loss and degradation of forest
        and aquatic ecosystems and, in many production systems, transition to intensive production of a reduced number
        of species, breeds and varieties, remain major drivers of loss of BFA and ecosystem services."[132]
        The health of humans is largely dependent on the product of an ecosystem. With biodiversity loss, a huge impact
        on human health comes as well. Biodiversity makes it possible for humans to have a sustainable level of soils
        and the means to have the genetic factors to have food.[133]
        Many activists and scholars have suggested that there is a connection between plant patent protection and the
        loss of crop biodiversity,[134] although such claims are contested.[135]

        The decrease in biodiversity has several implications for human health. One such implication is the loss of
        medicinal plants. The use of plants for medicinal purposes is extensive, with ~70 to 80% of individuals
        worldwide relying solely on plant-based medicine as their primary source of healthcare.[136] This dependency on
        plants for medicinal purposes is especially rife in developing countries.[136] Local knowledge surrounding
        medicinal plants is useful for screening for new herbal medicines that may be useful for treating disease.[137]
        Villages and communities which reside continually in a single geographic area over time, create, transmit and
        apply widespread information surrounding the medicinal resources in the area.[137] Formal scientific methods
        have been useful in identifying the active ingredients used in ethnopharmacy and applying them to modern
        medicines. However, it is important that medicinal resources are managed appropriately as they become globally
        traded in order to prevent species endangerment.[137] Changes to local ecosystems (such as access to food and
        clean water) can indirectly impact the local economy, and society (livihood and social interaction between
        people living in the impacted area). Therefore impacting the health of the people.[138]
        This section is an excerpt from Biodiversity hypothesis of health.[edit]

        Diagram of biodiversity hypothesis[139]
        According to the biodiversity hypothesis, reduced contact of people with natural environment and biodiversity
        may adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. The hypothesis is based
        on the observation that two dominant socio-ecological trends – the loss of biodiversity and increasing incidence
        of inflammatory diseases – are interconnected.[139][140][141]
        Urbanization and fragmentation of habitats increasingly lead to loss of connection between human and natural
        environment. Furthermore, immunological non-communicable diseases have become increasingly common in recent
        decades especially in urbanized communities.[142]

        There are so many conservation challenges when dealing with biodiversity loss that a joint effort needs to be
        made through public policies, economic solutions, monitoring and education by governments, NGOs,
        conservationists etc.[143] Incentives are required to protect species and conserve their natural habitat and
        disincentivize habitat loss and degradation (e.g. implementing sustainable development including targets of SDG
        15). Other ways to achieve this goal are enforcing laws that prevent poaching wildlife, protect species from
        overhunting and overfishing and keep the ecosystems they rely on intact and secure from species invasions and
        land use conversion.[144] Furthermore, conservation based models like the Global Safety Net are continuously
        being developed to consider the ecological connections that need to be addressed to effectively mitigate
        biodiversity loss.[145] According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
        Services (IPBES) action to protect biodiversity is very cost effective because it reduces the risk of pandemics
        due to pathogens from wildlife.[146]
        Conservationists and sustainable research scientists around the world have also developed systems-based
        approaches to help mitigate biodiversity loss. This methodology allows scientists to create contextual
        frameworks that consider the many nuances and linkages of environmental conservation like ecological footprints,
        planetary boundaries, ecological economics, etc.[147] Considering all the many ways in which the natural and
        human world intersect can help researchers understand the intricacies that lead to biodiversity loss and find
        patterns that can be applied to similar situations. One example of these type of frameworks is the triple bottom
        line, which has been adopted by many businesses and organizations to evaluate their impact and progress towards
        the marriage of social, environmental, and economic success.

        Earth's 25 terrestrial hot spots of biodiversity. These regions contain a number of plant and animal species and
        have been subjected to high levels of habitat destruction by human activity.
        There are many organizations devoted to the cause of prioritizing conservation efforts such as the Red List of
        Threatened Species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the
        United States Endangered Species Act. British environmental scientist Norman Myers and his colleagues have
        identified 25 terrestrial biodiversity hotspots that could serve as priorities for habitat protection.[149]
        Many governments in the world have conserved portions of their territories under the Convention on Biological
        Diversity (CBD), a multilateral treaty signed in 1992–3. The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, part of the CBD's
        Strategic Plan 2011–2020, were published in 2010.[150] Since 2010, approximately 164 countries have developed
        plans to reach their conservation targets, including the protection of 17 percent of terrestrial and inland
        waters and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas.[citation needed]
        In 2019 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an
        international organization formed to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
        (IPCC),[151] published the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services which said that up to
        a million plant and animal species are facing extinction because of human activities.[144][21] An October 2020
        report by IPBES stated that the same human activities which are the underlying drivers of climate change and
        biodiversity loss, such as the destruction of wildlife and wild habitats, are also the same drivers of
        pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.[152] In 2022, IPBES listed some of the primary drivers of the
        contemporary extinction crisis as being unsustainable fishing, hunting and logging.[153]
        According to the 2020 United Nations' Global Biodiversity Outlook report, of the 20 biodiversity goals laid out
        by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, only 6 were "partially achieved" by the deadline of 2020.[154] The
        report highlighted that if the status quo is not changed, biodiversity will continue to decline due to
        "currently unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, population growth and technological
        developments".[155] The report also singled out Australia, Brazil and Cameroon and the Galapagos Islands
        (Ecuador) for having had one of its animals lost to extinction in the past 10 years.[156] Following this, the
        leaders of 64 nations and the European Union pledged to halt environmental degradation and restore the natural
        world. Leaders from some of the world's biggest polluters, namely China, India, Russia, Brazil and the United
        States, were not among them.[157] Some experts contend that the refusal of the United States to ratify the
        Convention on Biological Diversity is harming global efforts to halt the extinction crisis.[158] Top scientists
        say that even if the 2010 targets had been met, it likely would not have resulted in any substantive reductions
        of current extinction rates.[23][1] Others have raised concerns that the Convention on Biological Diversity does
        not go far enough, and argue the goal should be zero extinctions by 2050, along with cutting the impact of
        unsustainable food production on nature by half. That the targets are not legally binding has also been subject
        to criticism.[159]
        In 2020, with passing of the 2020 target date for the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, scientists proposed a
        measurable, near-term biodiversity target – comparable to the below 2 °C global warming target – of keeping
        described species extinctions to well below 20 per year over the next 100 years across all major groups (fungi,

        terrestrial).[160]
        A 2021 collaborative report by scientists from the IPBES and the IPCC says that biodiversity loss and climate
        change must be addressed simultaneously, as they are inexorably linked and have similar effects on human
        well-being. Pamela McElwee, human ecologist and co-author of the report, says "climate has simply gotten more
        attention because people are increasingly feeling it in their own lives – whether it's wildfires or hurricane
        risk. Our report points out that biodiversity loss has that similar effect on human wellbeing."
