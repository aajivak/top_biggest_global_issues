        Change in average surface air temperature since the industrial revolution, plus drivers for that change. Human
        activity has caused increased temperatures, with natural forces adding some variability.[1]
        Contemporary climate change includes both global warming and its impacts on Earth's weather patterns. There have
        been previous periods of climate change, but the current rise in global average temperature is more rapid and is
        primarily caused by humans.[2][3] Burning fossil fuels adds greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, most importantly
        carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Smaller contributions come from agriculture, industrial processes, and forest
        loss.[4] Greenhouse gases warm the air by absorbing heat radiated by the Earth, trapping the heat near the
        surface. Greenhouse gas emissions amplify this effect, causing the Earth to take in more energy from sunlight
        than it can radiate back into space.
        Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5]
        Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6]
        Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid
        environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become
        extinct.[8] Climate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding, extreme heat, more
        disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[9] The World Health Organization
        (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[10] Even if efforts to
        minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include sea level rise,
        and warmer, more acidic oceans.[11]
        Many of these impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) level of warming. Additional warming will
        increase these impacts and may trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.[12] Under
        the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, with pledges
        made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century.[13]
        Limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[14]
        Some effects of climate change, clockwise from top left: Wildfire intensified by heat and drought, worsening
        droughts compromising water supplies, and bleaching of coral caused by ocean acidification and heating.
        Making deep cuts in emissions will require switching away from burning fossil fuels and towards using
        electricity generated from low-carbon sources. This includes phasing out coal-fired power plants, vastly
        increasing use of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, and taking measures to reduce energy use.
        Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering
        transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.[16][17] Carbon can also be removed from
        the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in
        soil.[18] While communities may adapt to climate change through efforts like better coastline protection, they
        cannot avert the risk of severe, widespread, and permanent impacts.[19]

    <h3 id="right-align-h-2">Observed temperature rise</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-2">

        Multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming.[31] The 2011–2020 decade
        warmed to an average 1.09 °C [0.95–1.20 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[32] Surface
        temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °C per decade,[33] with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2 °C above the
        pre-industrial era.[34] Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm
        days and nights has increased.[35]
        There was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century. Climate information for that
        period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.[36] Thermometer records began to provide global
        coverage around 1850.[37] Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the
        Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions. Temperatures may have reached as high
        as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions.[38] There have been prehistorical episodes of
        global warming, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum.[39] However, the modern observed rise in
        temperature and CO2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in Earth's history do
        not approach current rates.[40]
        Evidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other
        observations.[41][42] There has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting
        of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity.[43] Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner
        consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring.[44] Another key indicator is the
        cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's
        surface and preventing it from radiating into space.[45]

    <h3 id="left-align-h-3">Causes Regional aspects to temperature rises</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-3">
        Regions of the world warm at differing rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted,
        because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average
        surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface
        temperature.[46] This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by
        evaporation.[47] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least
        1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.[48][49] The rest has heated the
        atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.[50]
        The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere.
        The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice. As these
        surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more
        heat.[51] Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming.[52] Arctic temperatures
        are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.[53] Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the
        Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate

    <h3 id="right-align-h-4">Greenhouse gases</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-4">

        Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the
        Earth's surface. The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it. This absorption
        slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over
        time.[61] Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near
        the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence.[62][63] While water vapour (~50%)
        and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of
        temperature and are therefore feedbacks. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2 (~20%),
        tropospheric ozone,[64] CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external
        forcings.[65]
        Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and
        natural gas),[66] has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative
        imbalance. In 2019, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively,
        since 1750.[67] These CO2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years.
        Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years.[68]

        The Global Carbon Project shows how additions to CO2 since 1880 have been caused by different sources ramping up
        one after another.
        Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of CO2. Of these
        emissions, 75% was CO2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases.[69] CO2 emissions
        primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and
        electricity.[4] Additional CO2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the CO2
        released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser.[70] Methane emissions
        come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas
        extraction.[71] Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser.[72]
        Despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly
        its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for CO2. Land-surface sink processes, such as carbon fixation in
        the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global CO2 emissions.[73] The ocean also serves as a
        significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, CO2 dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the
        ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as
        part of the carbon cycle. Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted
        CO2.[74]
        Aerosols and clouds
        Air pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the
        climate on a large scale.[75] From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the
        Earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming,[76] typically attributed to
        aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.[77] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning
        that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.[78]
        Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation. They also have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget.
        Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets.
        These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.[79] They also
        reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.[80] Indirect effects of
        aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.[81]
        While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or
        ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases
        melting and sea-level rise.[82] Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by
        0.2 °C by 2050.[83]

    <h3 id="left-align-h-4">Land surface changes</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-4">
        The rate of global tree cover loss has approximately doubled since 2001, to an annual loss approaching an area
        the size of Italy.[84]
        Humans change the Earth's surface mainly to create more agricultural land. Today, agriculture takes up 34% of
        Earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.).[85] The amount of
        forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming.[86]
        Deforestation releases CO2 contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from
        absorbing more CO2 in the future.[87] The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from
        forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce
        forestry/forest products (26%), short term shifting cultivation (24%), and wildfires (23%).[88]
        Land use changes not only affect greenhouse gas emissions. The type of vegetation in a region affects the local
        temperature. It impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is
        lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing
        it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical
        compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns.[89] In tropic and temperate areas the net effect
        is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is
        replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect.[89] Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a
        slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.[90]

    <h3 id="right-align-h-5">Solar and volcanic activity</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-5">
        Physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into
        account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity.[91] As the Sun is the Earth's primary energy
        source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system.[81] Solar irradiance has been measured
        directly by satellites,[92] and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards.[81] There has
        been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth.[93] Further evidence for greenhouse
        gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere (the
        troposphere), coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere).[94] If solar variations were
        responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm.[59]
        Explosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era. When the eruption is
        sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a
        couple of years. The temperature signal lasts about twice as long. In the industrial era, volcanic activity has
        had negligible impacts on global temperature trends.[95] Present-day volcanic CO2 emissions are equivalent to
        less than 1% of current anthropogenic CO2 emissions.[96]

    <p id="left-align-p-6">
        The effects of climate change on humans have been observed worldwide. They are mostly due to warming and shifts
        in precipitation. Impacts can now be observed on all continents and ocean regions,[176] with low-latitude, less
        developed areas facing the greatest risk.[177] Continued warming has potentially “severe, pervasive and
        irreversible impacts” for people and ecosystems.[178] The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally
        greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.

    <h3 id="left-align-h-8">Clean energy</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-8">
        Renewable energy is key to limiting climate change.[224] Fossil fuels accounted for 80% of the world's energy in
        2018. The remaining share was split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind
        and solar power and geothermal energy).[225] That mix is projected to change significantly over the next 30
        years.[217] Solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation
        capacity in many locations.[226] Renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019,
        nearly all solar and wind.[227] Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a
        larger share of the energy supply. However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison.[228]
        To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation,
        rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios. Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly
        phased out by 2050.[229][230]
        Electricity would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport.[231] In transport,
        emissions can be reduced fast by a switch to electric vehicles.[232] Public transport and active transport
        (cycling and walking) also produce less CO2.[233] For shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels can be used to
        reduce emissions.[232] Heating would be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps.[234]
        There are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables. For wind and solar,
        there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects.[235] Wind and solar also produce energy
        intermittently and with seasonal variability. Traditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power
        plants have been used when variable energy production is low. Going forward, battery storage can be expanded,
        energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable
        outputs.[224] Bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security.[236]
        The growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around nuclear waste, nuclear weapon proliferation,
        and accidents.[237][238] Hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and
        new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns.[239]
        Low-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change. It also has the near-term benefit of
        reducing air pollution deaths,[240] which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016.[241] Meeting the Paris
        Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2 °C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by
        2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5 °C could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security
        and reduce poverty

    <h3 id="right-align-h-9">Energy conservation</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-9">
        Reducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions.[243] If less energy is needed, there is
        more flexibility for clean energy development. It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and
        minimises carbon-intensive infrastructure development.[244] Major increases in energy efficiency investment will
        be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy.[245] Several
        COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts
        for this decade more difficult and uncertain.[246]
        Strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector. In transport, passengers and freight can switch to more
        efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles.[247] Industrial strategies to reduce
        energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and
        increasing product lifetimes.[248] In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and
        higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting.[249] The use of technologies like heat pumps can also
        increase building energy efficiency.[250]

        Alpine flora at Logan Pass, Glacier National Park, in Montana, United States: Alpine plants are one group
        expected to be highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change
        Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local,
        regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the
        term.[81] Climate change is any significant long term change in the expected pattern, whether due to natural
        variability or as a result of human activity. Predicting the effects that climate change will have on plant
        biodiversity can be achieved using various models, however bioclimatic models are most commonly used.[82]
        Environmental conditions play a key role in defining the function and geographic distributions of plants, in
        combination with other factors, thereby modifying patterns of biodiversity.[83] Changes in long term
        environmental conditions that can be collectively coined climate change are known to have had enormous impacts
        on current plant diversity patterns; further impacts are expected in the future.[84] It is predicted that
        climate change will remain one of the major drivers of biodiversity patterns in the future.[85][86][87] Human
        actions are currently triggering the sixth major mass extinction our Earth has seen, changing the distribution
        and abundance of many plants.[88] A 2022 evaluation of vascular plant species suggests that species with no
        major uses in human society are much more likely to go extinct compared to plants actively cultivated for human
        purposes such as agriculture or urban decoration.[89]
        In addition, Pre-species barriers for plants are also the indirect effects of climate change due to human
        activities. First, as mentioned above, the reduction in the number of birds and insects used to help pollinate
        plants[90][91] will reduce the chance of mating between plants. Second, extended fire weather seasons may result
        in more severe burn conditions and shorter burn intervals, which can threaten the biodiversity of native
        vegetation.[92] Besides, species habitat changes or migrations under changing weather conditions can cause
        non-native plants[93] and pest to cause damage to native vegetation diversity, making them less structurally
        functional and more vulnerable to external damage,[94] which would all eventually lead to biodiversity loss.
        Plant and animal populations are interconnected. There are a number of examples in nature that display this
        dependency. Consider pollinator reliant plant species that display an observable sensitivity to pollinator
        activity.[95] A 2007 study looked into the relationship between plant diversity and phenology, experimentally
        determining that plant diversity influenced the broader community flowering time.[95] Flowering time is
        important piece in the pollination puzzle as it impacts the food supply for pollinators.[96] This in turn can
        play a major role in agricultural pursuits [96] and global food security.[97]
        While plants are essential for human survival, they have not received the same attention as the subject of
        conservation efforts as animals.[98] It's estimated that a third of all land plant species are at risk of
        extinction and 94% have yet to be evaluated in terms of their conservation status.[98]Plants existing at the
        lowest trophic level shows a need for an active effort for plant conservation as this will cause all higher
        levels to reduce in biodiversity in tandem with the reduction of plant biodiversity.[99]

        Many scientists have studied the effects of climate change on the community structures and behaviors of aquatic
        macroinvertebrates and microbes – which are the prominent foundation of nutrient cycling in aquatic
        systems.[100] These organisms are responsible for breaking down organic matter into essential carbon and
        nutrients that get cycled throughout the system and maintain health and production of the entire habitat.
        However, there have been numerous studies (through experimental warming) that have shown increases in microbial
        respiration of carbon out of the system, with a simultaneous decrease in leaf litter breakdown caused by
        temperature-sensitive macroinvertebrates.[101] As temperatures are expected to increase largely due to
        anthropogenic influence, the abundance, type, and efficiency of macroinvertebrate and microbial organisms in

        DPSIR: drivers, pressures, state, impact and response model of intervention
        Major factors for biotic stress and the ensuing accelerating loss rate are, amongst other threats:[102]
        1. Habitat loss and degradation
        Land use intensification (and ensuing land loss/habitat loss) has been identified to be a significant factor in
        loss of ecological services due to direct effects as well as biodiversity loss.[103]
        2. Climate change through heat stress and drought stress
        3. Excessive nutrient load and other forms of pollution
        4. Over-exploitation and unsustainable use (e.g. unsustainable fishing methods) we are currently using 25% more
        natural resources than the planet[clarification needed]
        5. Armed conflict, which disrupts human livelihoods and institutions, contributes to habitat loss, and
        intensifies over-exploitation of economically valuable species, leading to population declines and local
        extinctions.[104]
        6. Invasive alien species that effectively compete for a niche, replacing indigenous species[105]
        7. Drastic increases in the human population have greatly affected the Earth's ability to provide adequate
        resources for all forms of life.[106] Recent IUCN Red List reports indicate that 41% of amphibians, 14% of
        birds, and 26% of mammal species are currently threatened with extinction.[17]
        8. Habitat fragmentation for commercial and agricultural uses (specifically monoculture farming).[107]

        You know, when we first set up WWF, our objective was to save endangered species from extinction. But we have
        failed completely; we haven't managed to save a single one. If only we had put all that money into condoms, we

        The current rate of global diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally
        occurring) background extinction rate, faster than at any other time in human history,[7][8] and expected to
        still grow in the upcoming years.[9][10][11] These rapidly rising extinction trends impacting numerous animal
        groups including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and ray-finned fishes have prompted scientists to declare
        a contemporary biodiversity crisis.[12]
        Locally bounded loss rates can be measured using species richness and its variation over time. Raw counts may
        not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute[clarification needed] abundances. Taking into account
        the relative frequencies, many biodiversity indexes have been developed. Besides richness, evenness and
        heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.[4]
        As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the
        observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity of the subject increases and the
        associated spatial and temporal scales widen."[13] Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split
        up into various scales (e.g. ecosystem diversity vs. habitat diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat
        diversity[13]) or different subcategories (e.g. phylogenetic diversity, species diversity, genetic diversity,
        nucleotide diversity). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer
        observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.[14][15]
        To compare rates between different geographic regions, latitudinal gradients in species diversity should also be
        considered.
        In 2006, many more species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists
        have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized.[16]
        In 2021, about 28 percent of the 134,400 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as
        threatened with extinction—a total of 37,400 species compared to 16,119 threatened species in 2006.[17]
        A 2022 study published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, which surveyed more than 3,000 experts,
        states that "global biodiversity loss and its impacts may be greater than previously thought," and estimates
        that roughly 30% of species "have been globally threatened or driven extinct since the year 1500."[18][19]

        Main articles: Decline in insect populations, Insect biodiversity, Pollinator decline, and The Windshield
        Phenomenon
        In 2017, various publications described the dramatic reduction in absolute insect biomass and number of species
        in Germany and North America over a period of 27 years.[108][109] As possible reasons for the decline, the
        authors highlight neonicotinoids and other agrochemicals. Writing in the journal PLOS One, Hallman et al. (2017)
        conclude that "the widespread insect biomass decline is alarming."[110]
        For example, the critical decline of earthworms (over 80% on average) has been recorded under non-ecological
        agricultural practices.[111] Earthworms play an important role in ecosystem function.[111] For example, they
        help with biological processing in soil, water, and even green house gas balancing.[112] The decline of
        earthworm populations are said to be due to five reasons; soil degradation and destruction of habitat, climate
        change, biological invasion of nonnative species, poor soil management, and pollutant loading.[113] Factors like
        tillage practices and intensive land use decimate the soil and plant roots that earthworms use to create their
        biomass, causing carbon and nitrogen cycles to be impacted negatively. Knowledge of earthworm species diversity
        is quite limited as not even 50% of them have been described. More studies upon earthworms and how they provide
        their ecosystem services must be done to gain a better understanding of going about preserving their
        diversity.[113] With earthworm populations dwindling, this has caused for the Secretariat of the Convention on
        Biological Diversity to take action and promote the restoration and maintenance of the many diverse species of
        earthworms.[113]

        Certain types of pesticide, neonicotinoids, probably contribute to the decline of certain bird species.[114] A
        study funded by BirdLife International confirms that 51 species of birds are critically endangered and 8 could
        be classified as extinct or in danger of extinction. Nearly 30% of extinction is due to hunting and trapping for
        the exotic pet trade. Deforestation, caused by unsustainable logging and agriculture, could be the next
        extinction driver, because birds lose their habitat and their food. The biologist Luisa Arnedo said: "as soon as
        the habitat is gone, they're gone too".[115]
        Within the Amazon rainforest there is an area called Bele´m and it is an area of endemism. In Bele´m 76% of the
        land has already been stripped of its natural resources, including the trees of the forest.[116] Within the area
        bird species are strongly affected by the deforestation, due to being put in that situation 56% of the birds are
        now in danger of going into extinction. With the climate changing as well as their habitat, the population of
        the birds will continue to decline. Even with protected areas of land, the efficiency in which birds are
        conserved are low.[116]
        Modern bird hunting and trapping is a common practice in South America. Some cultures in Brazil encourage bird
        hunting and trapping for commercial reasons. Some reasons include, selling the wild birds as pets, breeding the
        birds and selling the young, selling the birds for food, and selling them for religious and medicinal
        purposes.[117]
        Another increasingly abundant threat to bird populations is collisions and electrocutions due to power
        lines.[118] Migratory species are at a higher risk of collision accidents and up to 1 billion birds are killed
        due to colliding with buildings each year in the United States.[119]

        Freshwater ecosystems ranging from swamps, deltas, to rivers make up to 1% of earths surface. Although making up
        such little proportion of the earth, freshwater ecosystems are important because these kind of habitats are home
        to approximately one third of vertebrate species.[120] Freshwater species are beginning to decline at twice the
        rate of other species such as those located on land or within the ocean, this rapid loss has already placed 27%
        of 29,500 species dependent on freshwater upon the IUCN Red List.[120] With freshwater species declining so
        quickly, it is due to the poor systems in place that don't provide any protection to their biodiversity.
        A study by 16 global conservation organizations found that the biodiversity crisis is most acute in freshwater
        ecosystems, with a rate of decline double that of oceans and forests. Global populations of freshwater fish are
        collapsing from anthropogenic impacts such as pollution and overfishing. Migratory fish populations have
        declined by 76% since 1970, and large "megafish" populations have fallen by 94% with 16 species declared extinct

        Marine biodiversity encompasses any living organism which resides in the ocean, and describes various complex
        relationships within marine ecosystems.[68] On a local and regional scale, marine communities are better
        understood compared to marine ecosystems on a global scale. In 2018, it was estimated that approximately 240,000
        marine species have been documented.[67] Based on this prediction, the discovery of total marine species ranges
        between 11% to 78% due to uncertainties regarding global marine biodiversity.[67] However, the number of
        described marine species remains low compared to terrestrial species due to various factors, which includes the
        assignment of different names for the same species, and insufficient taxa classification.[68] It is likely that
        many undocumented species have already disappeared. Because not all marine species have been described, it is
        difficult to provide an accurate estimate of global extinction in marine ecosystems. As a result, abundances of
        marine species remain uncertain, with estimates ranging between 178,000 and 10 million oceanic species.[68]
        With anthropogenic pressure, this results in human activities having the strongest influences on marine
        biodiversity, with main drivers of global extinction being habitat loss, pollution, invasive species, and
        overexploitation.[123][124] Greater pressure is placed on marine ecosystems with human settlements near coastal
        areas.[125] Other indirect factors that have resulted in marine species to decline include climate change and
        change to oceanic biochemistry.[123]
        Overexploitation has resulted in the extinction of over 20 described marine species, which includes seabirds,
        marine mammals, algae, and fishes.[68] Examples of extinct marine species include the Steller's sea cow
        (Hydrodamalis gigas) and the Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis). However, not all extinctions are because
        of humans. For example, in 1930, the eelgrass limpet (Lottia alveus) became extinct once the Zostera marina
        seagrass population declined upon exposure to a disease. The Lottia alveus were greatly impacted as the Zostera
        marina were their sole habitats.[68]

        Biodiversity loss also threatens the structure and proper functioning of the ecosystem. Although all ecosystems
        are able to adapt to the stresses associated with reductions in biodiversity to some degree, biodiversity loss
        reduces an ecosystem's complexity, as roles once played by multiple interacting species or multiple interacting
        individuals are played by fewer or none.[42] The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the
        mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and
        pathways of potential community change. At higher levels of extinction (40 to 60 percent of species), the
        effects of species loss ranked with those of many other major drivers of environmental change, such as ozone
        pollution, acid deposition on forests and nutrient pollution.[126] Finally, the effects are also seen on human
        needs such as clean water, air and food production over-time. For example, studies over the last two
        decades[when?] have demonstrated that more biologically diverse ecosystems are more productive.[127] As a
        result, there has been growing concern that the very high rates of modern extinctions – due to habitat loss,
        overharvesting and other human-caused environmental changes – could reduce nature's ability to provide goods and
        services like food, clean water and a stable climate.[128]
        An October 2020 analysis by Swiss Re found that one-fifth of all countries are at risk of ecosystem collapse as
        the result of anthropogenic habitat destruction and increased wildlife loss.[129]

        An infographic describing the relationship between biodiversity and food.
        In 2019, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization produced its first report on The State of the World's
        Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, which warned that "Many key components of biodiversity for food and
        agriculture at genetic, species and ecosystem levels are in decline."[130][131] The report states that this is
        being caused by "a variety of drivers operating at a range of levels" and more specifically that "major global
        trends such as changes in climate, international markets and demography give rise to more immediate drivers such
        as land-use change, pollution and overuse of external inputs, overharvesting and the proliferation of invasive
        species. Interactions between drivers often exacerbate their effects on biodiversity for food and agriculture
        (BFA). Demographic changes, urbanization, markets, trade and consumer preferences are reported [by the countries
        that provided inputs to the report] to have a strong influence on food systems, frequently with negative
        consequences for BFA and the ecosystem services it provides. However, such drivers are also reported to open
        opportunities to make food systems more sustainable, for example through the development of markets for
        biodiversity-friendly products."[132] It further states that "the driver mentioned by the highest number of
        countries as having negative effects on regulating and supporting ecosystem services [in food and agricultural
        production systems] is changes in land and water use and management" and that "loss and degradation of forest
        and aquatic ecosystems and, in many production systems, transition to intensive production of a reduced number
        of species, breeds and varieties, remain major drivers of loss of BFA and ecosystem services."[132]
        The health of humans is largely dependent on the product of an ecosystem. With biodiversity loss, a huge impact
        on human health comes as well. Biodiversity makes it possible for humans to have a sustainable level of soils
        and the means to have the genetic factors to have food.[133]
        Many activists and scholars have suggested that there is a connection between plant patent protection and the
        loss of crop biodiversity,[134] although such claims are contested.[135]

        The decrease in biodiversity has several implications for human health. One such implication is the loss of
        medicinal plants. The use of plants for medicinal purposes is extensive, with ~70 to 80% of individuals
        worldwide relying solely on plant-based medicine as their primary source of healthcare.[136] This dependency on
        plants for medicinal purposes is especially rife in developing countries.[136] Local knowledge surrounding
        medicinal plants is useful for screening for new herbal medicines that may be useful for treating disease.[137]
        Villages and communities which reside continually in a single geographic area over time, create, transmit and
        apply widespread information surrounding the medicinal resources in the area.[137] Formal scientific methods
        have been useful in identifying the active ingredients used in ethnopharmacy and applying them to modern
        medicines. However, it is important that medicinal resources are managed appropriately as they become globally
        traded in order to prevent species endangerment.[137] Changes to local ecosystems (such as access to food and
        clean water) can indirectly impact the local economy, and society (livihood and social interaction between
        people living in the impacted area). Therefore impacting the health of the people.[138]
        This section is an excerpt from Biodiversity hypothesis of health.[edit]

        Diagram of biodiversity hypothesis[139]
        According to the biodiversity hypothesis, reduced contact of people with natural environment and biodiversity
        may adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. The hypothesis is based
        on the observation that two dominant socio-ecological trends – the loss of biodiversity and increasing incidence
        of inflammatory diseases – are interconnected.[139][140][141]
        Urbanization and fragmentation of habitats increasingly lead to loss of connection between human and natural
        environment. Furthermore, immunological non-communicable diseases have become increasingly common in recent
        decades especially in urbanized communities.[142]

        There are so many conservation challenges when dealing with biodiversity loss that a joint effort needs to be
        made through public policies, economic solutions, monitoring and education by governments, NGOs,
        conservationists etc.[143] Incentives are required to protect species and conserve their natural habitat and
        disincentivize habitat loss and degradation (e.g. implementing sustainable development including targets of SDG
        15). Other ways to achieve this goal are enforcing laws that prevent poaching wildlife, protect species from
        overhunting and overfishing and keep the ecosystems they rely on intact and secure from species invasions and
        land use conversion.[144] Furthermore, conservation based models like the Global Safety Net are continuously
        being developed to consider the ecological connections that need to be addressed to effectively mitigate
        biodiversity loss.[145] According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
        Services (IPBES) action to protect biodiversity is very cost effective because it reduces the risk of pandemics
        due to pathogens from wildlife.[146]
        Conservationists and sustainable research scientists around the world have also developed systems-based
        approaches to help mitigate biodiversity loss. This methodology allows scientists to create contextual
        frameworks that consider the many nuances and linkages of environmental conservation like ecological footprints,
        planetary boundaries, ecological economics, etc.[147] Considering all the many ways in which the natural and
        human world intersect can help researchers understand the intricacies that lead to biodiversity loss and find
        patterns that can be applied to similar situations. One example of these type of frameworks is the triple bottom
        line, which has been adopted by many businesses and organizations to evaluate their impact and progress towards
        the marriage of social, environmental, and economic success.

        The public has a really strong sense of the climate crisis and that’s driving politics, certainly in the EU, but
        probably globally as well. It’s so manifest, the climate crisis, that it’s inevitable that it will need to be
        addressed by political leaders. The biodiversity crisis is not that manifest to many of our citizens.
        — Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission[148]

        Earth's 25 terrestrial hot spots of biodiversity. These regions contain a number of plant and animal species and
        have been subjected to high levels of habitat destruction by human activity.
        There are many organizations devoted to the cause of prioritizing conservation efforts such as the Red List of
        Threatened Species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the
        United States Endangered Species Act. British environmental scientist Norman Myers and his colleagues have
        identified 25 terrestrial biodiversity hotspots that could serve as priorities for habitat protection.[149]
        Many governments in the world have conserved portions of their territories under the Convention on Biological
        Diversity (CBD), a multilateral treaty signed in 1992–3. The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, part of the CBD's
        Strategic Plan 2011–2020, were published in 2010.[150] Since 2010, approximately 164 countries have developed
        plans to reach their conservation targets, including the protection of 17 percent of terrestrial and inland
        waters and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas.[citation needed]
        In 2019 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an
        international organization formed to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
        (IPCC),[151] published the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services which said that up to
        a million plant and animal species are facing extinction because of human activities.[144][21] An October 2020
        report by IPBES stated that the same human activities which are the underlying drivers of climate change and
        biodiversity loss, such as the destruction of wildlife and wild habitats, are also the same drivers of
        pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.[152] In 2022, IPBES listed some of the primary drivers of the
        contemporary extinction crisis as being unsustainable fishing, hunting and logging.[153]
        According to the 2020 United Nations' Global Biodiversity Outlook report, of the 20 biodiversity goals laid out
        by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, only 6 were "partially achieved" by the deadline of 2020.[154] The
        report highlighted that if the status quo is not changed, biodiversity will continue to decline due to
        "currently unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, population growth and technological
        developments".[155] The report also singled out Australia, Brazil and Cameroon and the Galapagos Islands
        (Ecuador) for having had one of its animals lost to extinction in the past 10 years.[156] Following this, the
        leaders of 64 nations and the European Union pledged to halt environmental degradation and restore the natural
        world. Leaders from some of the world's biggest polluters, namely China, India, Russia, Brazil and the United
        States, were not among them.[157] Some experts contend that the refusal of the United States to ratify the
        Convention on Biological Diversity is harming global efforts to halt the extinction crisis.[158] Top scientists
        say that even if the 2010 targets had been met, it likely would not have resulted in any substantive reductions
        of current extinction rates.[23][1] Others have raised concerns that the Convention on Biological Diversity does
        not go far enough, and argue the goal should be zero extinctions by 2050, along with cutting the impact of
        unsustainable food production on nature by half. That the targets are not legally binding has also been subject
        to criticism.[159]
        In 2020, with passing of the 2020 target date for the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, scientists proposed a
        measurable, near-term biodiversity target – comparable to the below 2 °C global warming target – of keeping
        described species extinctions to well below 20 per year over the next 100 years across all major groups (fungi,
        plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates) and across all ecosystem types (marine, freshwater, and
        terrestrial).[160]
        A 2021 collaborative report by scientists from the IPBES and the IPCC says that biodiversity loss and climate
        change must be addressed simultaneously, as they are inexorably linked and have similar effects on human
        well-being. Pamela McElwee, human ecologist and co-author of the report, says "climate has simply gotten more
        attention because people are increasingly feeling it in their own lives – whether it's wildfires or hurricane
        risk. Our report points out that biodiversity loss has that similar effect on human wellbeing."
