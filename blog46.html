        Habitat destruction (also termed habitat loss and habitat reduction) is the process by which a natural habitat becomes incapable of supporting its native species. The organisms that previously inhabited the site are displaced or dead, thereby reducing biodiversity and species abundance.[1][2] Habitat destruction is the leading cause of biodiversity loss.[3] Fragmentation and loss of habitat have become one of the most important topics of research in ecology as they are major threats to the survival of endangered species.[4]

        Activities such as harvesting natural resources, industrial production and urbanization are human contributions to habitat destruction. Pressure from agriculture is the principal human cause. Some others include mining, logging, trawling, and urban sprawl. Habitat destruction is currently considered the primary cause of species extinction worldwide.[5] Environmental factors can contribute to habitat destruction more indirectly. Geological processes, climate change,[2] introduction of invasive species, ecosystem nutrient depletion, water and noise pollution are some examples. Loss of habitat can be preceded by an initial habitat fragmentation.
        
        Attempts to address habitat destruction are in international policy commitments embodied by Sustainable Development Goal 15 "Life on Land" and Sustainable Development Goal 14 "Life Below Water". However, the United Nations Environment Programme report on "Making Peace with Nature" released in 2021 found that most of these efforts had failed to meet their internationally agreed upon goals.[6]

    <h3 id="right-align-h-2">Impacts on organisms</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-2">
        When a habitat is destroyed, the carrying capacity for indigenous plants, animals, and other organisms is reduced so that populations decline, sometimes up to the level of extinction.[7]

        Habitat loss is perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity.[8] Temple (1986) found that 82% of endangered bird species were significantly threatened by habitat loss. Most amphibian species are also threatened by native habitat loss,[9] and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat.[10] Endemic organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction, mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world, and thus have less chance of recovering. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem, resulting in their extinction. Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat, a phenomenon known as extinction debt. Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations. This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of infertile youths, as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population, or different species. One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China's giant panda, once found in many areas of Sichuan. Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country, as a result of widespread deforestation in the 20th century.[11]
        
        As habitat destruction of an area occurs, the species diversity offsets from a combination of habitat generalists and specialists to a population primarily consisting of generalist species.[3] Invasive species are frequently generalists that are able to survive in much more diverse habitats.[12] Habitat destruction leading to climate change offsets the balance of species keeping up with the extinction threshold leading to a higher likelihood of extinction.[13]
        
        Habitat loss is one of the main environmental causes of the decline of biodiversity on local, regional, and global scales. Many believe that habitat fragmentation is also a threat to biodiversity however some believe that it is secondary to habitat loss.[14] The reduction of the amount of habitat available results in specific landscapes that are made of isolated patches of suitable habitat throughout a hostile environment/matrix. This process is generally due to pure habitat loss as well as fragmentation effects. Pure habitat loss refers to changes occurring in the composition of the landscape that causes a decrease in individuals. Fragmentation effects refers to an addition of effects occurring due to the habitat changes.[4] Habitat loss can result in negative effects on the dynamic of species richness. The order Hymenoptera is a diverse group of plant pollinators who are highly susceptible to the negative effects of habitat loss, this could result in a domino effect between the plant-pollinator interactions leading to major conservation implications within this group.[15]

    <h3 id="left-align-h-3">Destruction of populations</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-3">
        Habitat fragmentation has a major impact on animal specie populations because it deprives species of what they are naturally accustomed to. This makes the species isolated, reduces the area where they can live, and creates new ecological boundaries. Some studies have shown that changes in the abiotic and biotic parameters have caused a greater impact on the ecology than the reduction in habitat size itself. They concluded that crowding a species into one space will eventually lead to the extinction of that species.[16]

        The destruction and fragmentation of natural habitats are currently the leading factors in species extinction. This is because the loss and fragmentation of habitats results in much smaller populations. Reduced population sizes ends up creating higher chances of extinction.[17]
        
        Studies have shown that there is no relationship between habitat patch and species number when it comes to habitat specialist plants species located in fragmented landscapes. This could potentially be due to drastic declines of plant species areas due to changes in the surrounding land.[14]

    <h3 id="right-align-h-4">Geography</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-4">
        Biodiversity hotspots are chiefly tropical regions that feature high concentrations of endemic species and, when all hotspots are combined, may contain over half of the world's terrestrial species.[21] These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction. Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed (WRI, 2003). Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include New Zealand, Madagascar, the Philippines, and Japan.[22] South and East Asia—especially China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Japan—and many areas in West Africa have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat. Marine areas close to highly populated coastal cities also face degradation of their coral reefs or other marine habitat. These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa, northern coasts of South America, and the Caribbean Sea and its associated islands.[22]

        Regions of unsustainable agriculture or unstable governments, which may go hand-in-hand, typically experience high rates of habitat destruction. South Asia, Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Amazonian tropical rainforest areas of South America are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and/or government mismanagement.[22]
        
        Areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction. In the U.S., less than 25% of native vegetation remains in many parts of the East and Midwest.[23] Only 15% of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe.[22]
        
        Currently, changes occurring in different environments around the world are changing the specific geographical habitats that are suitable for plants to grow. Therefore, the ability for plants to migrate to suitable environment areas will have a strong impact on the distribution of plant diversity. However, at the moment, the rates of plant migration that are influenced by habitat loss and fragmentation are not as well understood as they could be.[24]

    <h3 id="left-align-h-4">Ecosystems</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-4">
        Tropical rainforests have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat. From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide, less than 9 million square kilometers remain today.[22] The current rate of deforestation is 160,000 square kilometers per year, which equates to a loss of approximately 1% of original forest habitat each year.[25]

        Other forest ecosystems have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical rainforests. Deforestation for farming and logging have severely disturbed at least 94% of temperate broadleaf forests; many old growth forest stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities.[22] Tropical deciduous dry forests are easier to clear and burn and are more suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast and less than 8% in Madagascar remain from their original extents.[25]

        Plains and desert areas have been degraded to a lesser extent. Only 10–20% of the world's drylands, which include temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, scrub, and deciduous forests, have been somewhat degraded.[26] But included in that 10–20% of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification.[22] The tallgrass prairies of North America, on the other hand, have less than 3% of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland.[27]

        Wetlands and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction. More than 50% of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years.[23] Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely destroyed.[28] In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years. The rising sea levels and temperatures have caused soil erosion, coastal flooding, and loss of quality in the UK marine ecosystem.[29] About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans.[30] One-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed, and another fifth has been severely degraded by overfishing, pollution, and invasive species; 90% of the Philippines' coral reefs alone have been destroyed.[31] Finally, over 35% of the mangrove ecosystems worldwide have been destroyed.[31]

    <h3 id="right-align-h-5">Natural causes</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-5">
        Habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, fire, and climate change is well documented in the fossil record.[2] One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.[2]

    <p id="left-align-p-6">
        Mass fishing of Pacific jack mackerel (with possible bycatch) with a Chilean purse seiner.
        Human demands and consumption have resulted in overfishing, which leads to a loss in biodiversity with reduction
        to fish species richness and abundances.[66] In 2020, global fish abundances have reduced by 38% compared to
        fish population in 1970.[67] Reduction in global fish populations were first noticed during the 1990s.
        Currently, many commercial fishes have been overharvested; approximately 27% of exploited fish stocks in the
        United States are classified overfished.[68] In Tasmania, it was observed that over 50% of major fisheries
        species, such as the eastern gemfish, southern rock lobster, southern bulkefin tuna, jack mackerel, and
        trumpeter, have declined over the past 75 years due to overfishing.[69]
        Fishery methods, such as bottom trawling and longline fishing have caused habitat destruction, resulting spatial
        diversity and regional species richness to decline.[67][70] What these methods cause is an issue of bycatch.[71]
        The problem with bycatch is that there is a lack of reportage done from what species have been caught, a lot of
        the time an unwanted target is caught they are reported as "mixed fish" or are not reported.[70] Unwanted
        species caught within bycatch tend to be released,but it's common that captured fish die while in captivity, or
        die after being released. With an overexploitation of species being removed from their ecosystem, the trophic
        level becomes interrupted which in turn disrupts the food web.Some studies, including the 2019 Intergovernmental
        Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report, found that overfishing is the main driver
        of mass species extinction in the oceans.[72][73] Overfishing has reduced fish and marine mammal biomass by 60%
        since the 1800s,[74] and is currently driving over one-third of sharks and rays to extinction.[75]

        change that will have the most significant impact.[79][80] Some of the possible consequences of these effects

        shift from forests being carbon sinks to carbon sources, ocean acidification, disruption of the water cycle, and

        Alpine flora at Logan Pass, Glacier National Park, in Montana, United States: Alpine plants are one group
        expected to be highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change
        Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local,
        regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the
        term.[81] Climate change is any significant long term change in the expected pattern, whether due to natural
        variability or as a result of human activity. Predicting the effects that climate change will have on plant
        biodiversity can be achieved using various models, however bioclimatic models are most commonly used.[82]
        Environmental conditions play a key role in defining the function and geographic distributions of plants, in
        combination with other factors, thereby modifying patterns of biodiversity.[83] Changes in long term
        environmental conditions that can be collectively coined climate change are known to have had enormous impacts
        on current plant diversity patterns; further impacts are expected in the future.[84] It is predicted that
        climate change will remain one of the major drivers of biodiversity patterns in the future.[85][86][87] Human
        actions are currently triggering the sixth major mass extinction our Earth has seen, changing the distribution
        and abundance of many plants.[88] A 2022 evaluation of vascular plant species suggests that species with no
        major uses in human society are much more likely to go extinct compared to plants actively cultivated for human
        purposes such as agriculture or urban decoration.[89]
        In addition, Pre-species barriers for plants are also the indirect effects of climate change due to human
        activities. First, as mentioned above, the reduction in the number of birds and insects used to help pollinate
        plants[90][91] will reduce the chance of mating between plants. Second, extended fire weather seasons may result
        in more severe burn conditions and shorter burn intervals, which can threaten the biodiversity of native
        vegetation.[92] Besides, species habitat changes or migrations under changing weather conditions can cause
        non-native plants[93] and pest to cause damage to native vegetation diversity, making them less structurally
        functional and more vulnerable to external damage,[94] which would all eventually lead to biodiversity loss.
        Plant and animal populations are interconnected. There are a number of examples in nature that display this
        dependency. Consider pollinator reliant plant species that display an observable sensitivity to pollinator
        activity.[95] A 2007 study looked into the relationship between plant diversity and phenology, experimentally
        determining that plant diversity influenced the broader community flowering time.[95] Flowering time is
        important piece in the pollination puzzle as it impacts the food supply for pollinators.[96] This in turn can
        play a major role in agricultural pursuits [96] and global food security.[97]
        While plants are essential for human survival, they have not received the same attention as the subject of
        conservation efforts as animals.[98] It's estimated that a third of all land plant species are at risk of
        extinction and 94% have yet to be evaluated in terms of their conservation status.[98]Plants existing at the
        lowest trophic level shows a need for an active effort for plant conservation as this will cause all higher
        levels to reduce in biodiversity in tandem with the reduction of plant biodiversity.[99]

        Land use intensification (and ensuing land loss/habitat loss) has been identified to be a significant factor in
        loss of ecological services due to direct effects as well as biodiversity loss.[103]

        Demonstrator against biodiversity loss, at Extinction Rebellion (2018).
        You know, when we first set up WWF, our objective was to save endangered species from extinction. But we have
        failed completely; we haven't managed to save a single one. If only we had put all that money into condoms, we
        might have done some good.
        — Sir Peter Scott, Founder of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Cosmos Magazine, 2010[6]
        The current rate of global diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally
        occurring) background extinction rate, faster than at any other time in human history,[7][8] and expected to
        still grow in the upcoming years.[9][10][11] These rapidly rising extinction trends impacting numerous animal
        groups including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and ray-finned fishes have prompted scientists to declare
        a contemporary biodiversity crisis.[12]
        Locally bounded loss rates can be measured using species richness and its variation over time. Raw counts may
        not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute[clarification needed] abundances. Taking into account
        the relative frequencies, many biodiversity indexes have been developed. Besides richness, evenness and
        heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.[4]
        As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the
        observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity of the subject increases and the
        associated spatial and temporal scales widen."[13] Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split
        up into various scales (e.g. ecosystem diversity vs. habitat diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat
        diversity[13]) or different subcategories (e.g. phylogenetic diversity, species diversity, genetic diversity,
        nucleotide diversity). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer
        observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.[14][15]
        To compare rates between different geographic regions, latitudinal gradients in species diversity should also be
        considered.
        In 2006, many more species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists
        have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized.[16]
        In 2021, about 28 percent of the 134,400 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as
        threatened with extinction—a total of 37,400 species compared to 16,119 threatened species in 2006.[17]
        A 2022 study published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, which surveyed more than 3,000 experts,
        states that "global biodiversity loss and its impacts may be greater than previously thought," and estimates
        that roughly 30% of species "have been globally threatened or driven extinct since the year 1500."[18][19]

        Main articles: Decline in insect populations, Insect biodiversity, Pollinator decline, and The Windshield
        Phenomenon
        In 2017, various publications described the dramatic reduction in absolute insect biomass and number of species
        in Germany and North America over a period of 27 years.[108][109] As possible reasons for the decline, the
        authors highlight neonicotinoids and other agrochemicals. Writing in the journal PLOS One, Hallman et al. (2017)
        conclude that "the widespread insect biomass decline is alarming."[110]
        For example, the critical decline of earthworms (over 80% on average) has been recorded under non-ecological
        agricultural practices.[111] Earthworms play an important role in ecosystem function.[111] For example, they
        help with biological processing in soil, water, and even green house gas balancing.[112] The decline of
        earthworm populations are said to be due to five reasons; soil degradation and destruction of habitat, climate
        change, biological invasion of nonnative species, poor soil management, and pollutant loading.[113] Factors like
        tillage practices and intensive land use decimate the soil and plant roots that earthworms use to create their
        biomass, causing carbon and nitrogen cycles to be impacted negatively. Knowledge of earthworm species diversity
        is quite limited as not even 50% of them have been described. More studies upon earthworms and how they provide
        their ecosystem services must be done to gain a better understanding of going about preserving their
        diversity.[113] With earthworm populations dwindling, this has caused for the Secretariat of the Convention on
        Biological Diversity to take action and promote the restoration and maintenance of the many diverse species of
        earthworms.[113]

        The current rate of global diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally
        occurring) background extinction rate, faster than at any other time in human history,[7][8] and expected to

        groups including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and ray-finned fishes have prompted scientists to declare
        a contemporary biodiversity crisis.[12]
        Locally bounded loss rates can be measured using species richness and its variation over time. Raw counts may

        Certain types of pesticide, neonicotinoids, probably contribute to the decline of certain bird species.[114] A
        study funded by BirdLife International confirms that 51 species of birds are critically endangered and 8 could
        be classified as extinct or in danger of extinction. Nearly 30% of extinction is due to hunting and trapping for
        the exotic pet trade. Deforestation, caused by unsustainable logging and agriculture, could be the next
        extinction driver, because birds lose their habitat and their food. The biologist Luisa Arnedo said: "as soon as
        the habitat is gone, they're gone too".[115]
        Within the Amazon rainforest there is an area called Bele´m and it is an area of endemism. In Bele´m 76% of the
        land has already been stripped of its natural resources, including the trees of the forest.[116] Within the area
        bird species are strongly affected by the deforestation, due to being put in that situation 56% of the birds are
        now in danger of going into extinction. With the climate changing as well as their habitat, the population of
        the birds will continue to decline. Even with protected areas of land, the efficiency in which birds are
        conserved are low.[116]
        Modern bird hunting and trapping is a common practice in South America. Some cultures in Brazil encourage bird
        hunting and trapping for commercial reasons. Some reasons include, selling the wild birds as pets, breeding the
        birds and selling the young, selling the birds for food, and selling them for religious and medicinal
        purposes.[117]
        Another increasingly abundant threat to bird populations is collisions and electrocutions due to power
        lines.[118] Migratory species are at a higher risk of collision accidents and up to 1 billion birds are killed
        due to colliding with buildings each year in the United States.[119]

        Freshwater ecosystems ranging from swamps, deltas, to rivers make up to 1% of earths surface. Although making up
        such little proportion of the earth, freshwater ecosystems are important because these kind of habitats are home
        to approximately one third of vertebrate species.[120] Freshwater species are beginning to decline at twice the
        rate of other species such as those located on land or within the ocean, this rapid loss has already placed 27%
        of 29,500 species dependent on freshwater upon the IUCN Red List.[120] With freshwater species declining so
        quickly, it is due to the poor systems in place that don't provide any protection to their biodiversity.
        A study by 16 global conservation organizations found that the biodiversity crisis is most acute in freshwater
        ecosystems, with a rate of decline double that of oceans and forests. Global populations of freshwater fish are
        collapsing from anthropogenic impacts such as pollution and overfishing. Migratory fish populations have
        declined by 76% since 1970, and large "megafish" populations have fallen by 94% with 16 species declared extinct

        Marine biodiversity encompasses any living organism which resides in the ocean, and describes various complex
        relationships within marine ecosystems.[68] On a local and regional scale, marine communities are better
        understood compared to marine ecosystems on a global scale. In 2018, it was estimated that approximately 240,000
        marine species have been documented.[67] Based on this prediction, the discovery of total marine species ranges
        between 11% to 78% due to uncertainties regarding global marine biodiversity.[67] However, the number of
        described marine species remains low compared to terrestrial species due to various factors, which includes the
        assignment of different names for the same species, and insufficient taxa classification.[68] It is likely that
        many undocumented species have already disappeared. Because not all marine species have been described, it is
        difficult to provide an accurate estimate of global extinction in marine ecosystems. As a result, abundances of
        marine species remain uncertain, with estimates ranging between 178,000 and 10 million oceanic species.[68]
        With anthropogenic pressure, this results in human activities having the strongest influences on marine
        biodiversity, with main drivers of global extinction being habitat loss, pollution, invasive species, and
        overexploitation.[123][124] Greater pressure is placed on marine ecosystems with human settlements near coastal
        areas.[125] Other indirect factors that have resulted in marine species to decline include climate change and
        change to oceanic biochemistry.[123]
        Overexploitation has resulted in the extinction of over 20 described marine species, which includes seabirds,
        marine mammals, algae, and fishes.[68] Examples of extinct marine species include the Steller's sea cow
        (Hydrodamalis gigas) and the Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis). However, not all extinctions are because
        of humans. For example, in 1930, the eelgrass limpet (Lottia alveus) became extinct once the Zostera marina
        seagrass population declined upon exposure to a disease. The Lottia alveus were greatly impacted as the Zostera
        marina were their sole habitats.[68]

        Biodiversity loss also threatens the structure and proper functioning of the ecosystem. Although all ecosystems
        are able to adapt to the stresses associated with reductions in biodiversity to some degree, biodiversity loss
        reduces an ecosystem's complexity, as roles once played by multiple interacting species or multiple interacting
        individuals are played by fewer or none.[42] The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the
        mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and
        pathways of potential community change. At higher levels of extinction (40 to 60 percent of species), the
        effects of species loss ranked with those of many other major drivers of environmental change, such as ozone
        pollution, acid deposition on forests and nutrient pollution.[126] Finally, the effects are also seen on human
        needs such as clean water, air and food production over-time. For example, studies over the last two
        decades[when?] have demonstrated that more biologically diverse ecosystems are more productive.[127] As a
        result, there has been growing concern that the very high rates of modern extinctions – due to habitat loss,
        overharvesting and other human-caused environmental changes – could reduce nature's ability to provide goods and
        services like food, clean water and a stable climate.[128]
        An October 2020 analysis by Swiss Re found that one-fifth of all countries are at risk of ecosystem collapse as
        the result of anthropogenic habitat destruction and increased wildlife loss.[129]

        An infographic describing the relationship between biodiversity and food.
        In 2019, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization produced its first report on The State of the World's
        Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, which warned that "Many key components of biodiversity for food and
        agriculture at genetic, species and ecosystem levels are in decline."[130][131] The report states that this is
        being caused by "a variety of drivers operating at a range of levels" and more specifically that "major global
        trends such as changes in climate, international markets and demography give rise to more immediate drivers such
        as land-use change, pollution and overuse of external inputs, overharvesting and the proliferation of invasive
        species. Interactions between drivers often exacerbate their effects on biodiversity for food and agriculture
        (BFA). Demographic changes, urbanization, markets, trade and consumer preferences are reported [by the countries
        that provided inputs to the report] to have a strong influence on food systems, frequently with negative
        consequences for BFA and the ecosystem services it provides. However, such drivers are also reported to open
        opportunities to make food systems more sustainable, for example through the development of markets for
        biodiversity-friendly products."[132] It further states that "the driver mentioned by the highest number of
        countries as having negative effects on regulating and supporting ecosystem services [in food and agricultural
        production systems] is changes in land and water use and management" and that "loss and degradation of forest
        and aquatic ecosystems and, in many production systems, transition to intensive production of a reduced number
        of species, breeds and varieties, remain major drivers of loss of BFA and ecosystem services."[132]
        The health of humans is largely dependent on the product of an ecosystem. With biodiversity loss, a huge impact
        on human health comes as well. Biodiversity makes it possible for humans to have a sustainable level of soils
        and the means to have the genetic factors to have food.[133]
        Many activists and scholars have suggested that there is a connection between plant patent protection and the
        loss of crop biodiversity,[134] although such claims are contested.[135]

        The decrease in biodiversity has several implications for human health. One such implication is the loss of
        medicinal plants. The use of plants for medicinal purposes is extensive, with ~70 to 80% of individuals
        worldwide relying solely on plant-based medicine as their primary source of healthcare.[136] This dependency on
        plants for medicinal purposes is especially rife in developing countries.[136] Local knowledge surrounding
        medicinal plants is useful for screening for new herbal medicines that may be useful for treating disease.[137]
        Villages and communities which reside continually in a single geographic area over time, create, transmit and
        apply widespread information surrounding the medicinal resources in the area.[137] Formal scientific methods
        have been useful in identifying the active ingredients used in ethnopharmacy and applying them to modern
        medicines. However, it is important that medicinal resources are managed appropriately as they become globally
        traded in order to prevent species endangerment.[137] Changes to local ecosystems (such as access to food and
        clean water) can indirectly impact the local economy, and society (livihood and social interaction between
        people living in the impacted area). Therefore impacting the health of the people.[138]
        This section is an excerpt from Biodiversity hypothesis of health.[edit]

        Diagram of biodiversity hypothesis[139]
        According to the biodiversity hypothesis, reduced contact of people with natural environment and biodiversity
        may adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. The hypothesis is based
        on the observation that two dominant socio-ecological trends – the loss of biodiversity and increasing incidence
        of inflammatory diseases – are interconnected.[139][140][141]
        Urbanization and fragmentation of habitats increasingly lead to loss of connection between human and natural
        environment. Furthermore, immunological non-communicable diseases have become increasingly common in recent
        decades especially in urbanized communities.[142]

        There are so many conservation challenges when dealing with biodiversity loss that a joint effort needs to be
        made through public policies, economic solutions, monitoring and education by governments, NGOs,
        conservationists etc.[143] Incentives are required to protect species and conserve their natural habitat and
        disincentivize habitat loss and degradation (e.g. implementing sustainable development including targets of SDG
        15). Other ways to achieve this goal are enforcing laws that prevent poaching wildlife, protect species from
        overhunting and overfishing and keep the ecosystems they rely on intact and secure from species invasions and
        land use conversion.[144] Furthermore, conservation based models like the Global Safety Net are continuously
        being developed to consider the ecological connections that need to be addressed to effectively mitigate
        biodiversity loss.[145] According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
        Services (IPBES) action to protect biodiversity is very cost effective because it reduces the risk of pandemics
        due to pathogens from wildlife.[146]
        Conservationists and sustainable research scientists around the world have also developed systems-based
        approaches to help mitigate biodiversity loss. This methodology allows scientists to create contextual
        frameworks that consider the many nuances and linkages of environmental conservation like ecological footprints,
        planetary boundaries, ecological economics, etc.[147] Considering all the many ways in which the natural and
        human world intersect can help researchers understand the intricacies that lead to biodiversity loss and find
        patterns that can be applied to similar situations. One example of these type of frameworks is the triple bottom
        line, which has been adopted by many businesses and organizations to evaluate their impact and progress towards
        the marriage of social, environmental, and economic success.

        Earth's 25 terrestrial hot spots of biodiversity. These regions contain a number of plant and animal species and
        have been subjected to high levels of habitat destruction by human activity.
        There are many organizations devoted to the cause of prioritizing conservation efforts such as the Red List of
        Threatened Species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the
        United States Endangered Species Act. British environmental scientist Norman Myers and his colleagues have
        identified 25 terrestrial biodiversity hotspots that could serve as priorities for habitat protection.[149]
        Many governments in the world have conserved portions of their territories under the Convention on Biological
        Diversity (CBD), a multilateral treaty signed in 1992–3. The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, part of the CBD's
        Strategic Plan 2011–2020, were published in 2010.[150] Since 2010, approximately 164 countries have developed
        plans to reach their conservation targets, including the protection of 17 percent of terrestrial and inland
        waters and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas.[citation needed]
        In 2019 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an
        international organization formed to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
        (IPCC),[151] published the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services which said that up to
        a million plant and animal species are facing extinction because of human activities.[144][21] An October 2020
        report by IPBES stated that the same human activities which are the underlying drivers of climate change and
        biodiversity loss, such as the destruction of wildlife and wild habitats, are also the same drivers of
        pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.[152] In 2022, IPBES listed some of the primary drivers of the
        contemporary extinction crisis as being unsustainable fishing, hunting and logging.[153]
        According to the 2020 United Nations' Global Biodiversity Outlook report, of the 20 biodiversity goals laid out
        by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, only 6 were "partially achieved" by the deadline of 2020.[154] The
        report highlighted that if the status quo is not changed, biodiversity will continue to decline due to
        "currently unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, population growth and technological
        developments".[155] The report also singled out Australia, Brazil and Cameroon and the Galapagos Islands
        (Ecuador) for having had one of its animals lost to extinction in the past 10 years.[156] Following this, the
        leaders of 64 nations and the European Union pledged to halt environmental degradation and restore the natural
        world. Leaders from some of the world's biggest polluters, namely China, India, Russia, Brazil and the United
        States, were not among them.[157] Some experts contend that the refusal of the United States to ratify the
        Convention on Biological Diversity is harming global efforts to halt the extinction crisis.[158] Top scientists
        say that even if the 2010 targets had been met, it likely would not have resulted in any substantive reductions
        of current extinction rates.[23][1] Others have raised concerns that the Convention on Biological Diversity does
        not go far enough, and argue the goal should be zero extinctions by 2050, along with cutting the impact of
        unsustainable food production on nature by half. That the targets are not legally binding has also been subject
        to criticism.[159]
        In 2020, with passing of the 2020 target date for the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, scientists proposed a
        measurable, near-term biodiversity target – comparable to the below 2 °C global warming target – of keeping
        described species extinctions to well below 20 per year over the next 100 years across all major groups (fungi,
        plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates) and across all ecosystem types (marine, freshwater, and
        terrestrial).[160]
        A 2021 collaborative report by scientists from the IPBES and the IPCC says that biodiversity loss and climate
        change must be addressed simultaneously, as they are inexorably linked and have similar effects on human
        well-being. Pamela McElwee, human ecologist and co-author of the report, says "climate has simply gotten more
        attention because people are increasingly feeling it in their own lives – whether it's wildfires or hurricane
        risk. Our report points out that biodiversity loss has that similar effect on human wellbeing."
