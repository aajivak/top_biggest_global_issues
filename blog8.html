    <h3 id="left-align-h">Gray Goo</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p">
        Gray goo (also spelled as grey goo) is a hypothetical global catastrophic scenario involving molecular nanotechnology in which out-of-control self-replicating machines consume all biomass on Earth while building more of themselves,[1][2] a scenario that has been called ecophagy (the literal consumption of the ecosystem).[3] The original idea assumed machines were designed to have this capability, while popularizations have assumed that machines might somehow gain this capability by accident.

        Self-replicating machines of the macroscopic variety were originally described by mathematician John von Neumann, and are sometimes referred to as von Neumann machines or clanking replicators. The term gray goo was coined by nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation.[4] In 2004, he stated "I wish I had never used the term 'gray goo'."[5] Engines of Creation mentions "gray goo" as a thought experiment in two paragraphs and a note, while the popularized idea of gray goo was first publicized in a mass-circulation magazine, Omni, in November 1986.[6]

    <h3 id="right-align-h-2">Defination</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-2">
        The term was first used by molecular nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in Engines of Creation (1986). In Chapter 4, Engines Of Abundance, Drexler illustrates both exponential growth and inherent limits (not gray goo) by describing "dry" nanomachines that can function only if given special raw materials:

        Imagine such a replicator floating in a bottle of chemicals, making copies of itself...the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four, and the eight build another eight. At the end of ten hours, there are not thirty-six new replicators, but over 68 billion. In less than a day, they would weigh a ton; in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined — if the bottle of chemicals hadn't run dry long before.
    
    According to Drexler, the term was popularized by an article in science fiction magazine Omni, which also popularized the term "nanotechnology" in the same issue. Drexler says arms control is a far greater issue than gray goo "nanobugs".[7]
    
    In a History Channel broadcast, a contrasting idea (a kind of gray goo) is referred to in a futuristic End time scenario:
    
        In a common practice, billions of nanobots are released to clean up an oil spill off the coast of Louisiana. However, due to a programming error, the nanobots devour all carbon based objects, instead of just the hydrocarbons of the oil. The nanobots destroy everything, all the while, replicating themselves. Within days, the planet is turned to dust.[8]
    
    Drexler describes gray goo in Chapter 11 of Engines of Creation:
    
        Early assembler-based replicators could beat the most advanced modern organisms. 'Plants' with 'leaves' no more efficient than today's solar cells could out-compete real plants, crowding the biosphere with an inedible foliage. Tough, omnivorous 'bacteria' could out-compete real bacteria: they could spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to dust in a matter of days. Dangerous replicators could easily be too tough, small, and rapidly spreading to stop — at least if we made no preparation. We have trouble enough controlling viruses and fruit flies.
    
    Drexler notes that the geometric growth made possible by self-replication is inherently limited by the availability of suitable raw materials. Drexler used the term "gray goo" not to indicate color or texture, but to emphasize the difference between "superiority" in terms of human values and "superiority" in terms of competitive success:
    
        Though masses of uncontrolled replicators need not be grey or gooey, the term "grey goo" emphasizes that replicators able to obliterate life might be less inspiring than a single species of crabgrass. They might be "superior" in an evolutionary sense, but this need not make them valuable.
    
    Bill Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, discussed some of the problems with pursuing this technology in his now-famous 2000 article in Wired magazine, titled "Why The Future Doesn't Need Us". In direct response to Joy's concerns, the first quantitative technical analysis of the ecophagy scenario was published in 2000 by nanomedicine pioneer Robert Freitas.[

    <h3 id="left-align-h-3">Risks and precautions</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-3">
        Drexler more recently conceded that there is no need to build anything that even resembles a potential runaway replicator. This would avoid the problem entirely. In a paper in the journal Nanotechnology, he argues that self-replicating machines are needlessly complex and inefficient. His 1992 technical book on advanced nanotechnologies Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation[9] describes manufacturing systems that are desktop-scale factories with specialized machines in fixed locations and conveyor belts to move parts from place to place. None of these measures would prevent a party from creating a weaponized gray goo, were such a thing possible.

King Charles III called upon the British Royal Society to investigate the "enormous environmental and social risks" of nanotechnology in a planned report, leading to much media commentary on gray goo. The Royal Society's report on nanoscience was released on 29 July 2004, and declared the possibility of self-replicating machines to lie too far in the future to be of concern to regulators.[10]

More recent analysis in the paper titled Safe Exponential Manufacturing from the Institute of Physics (co-written by Chris Phoenix, Director of Research of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, and Eric Drexler), shows that the danger of gray goo is far less likely than originally thought.[11] However, other long-term major risks to society and the environment from nanotechnology have been identified.[12] Drexler has made a somewhat public effort to retract his gray goo hypothesis, in an effort to focus the debate on more realistic threats associated with knowledge-enabled nanoterrorism and other misuses.[13]

In Safe Exponential Manufacturing, which was published in a 2004 issue of Nanotechnology, it was suggested that creating manufacturing systems with the ability to self-replicate by the use of their own energy sources would not be needed.[14] The Foresight Institute also recommended embedding controls in the molecular machines. These controls would be able to prevent anyone from purposely abusing nanotechnology, and therefore avoid the gray goo scenario.[15

    <!-- <h3 id="right-align-h-4">Change in land use</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-4">
        The Forest Landscape Integrity Index measures global anthropogenic modification on remaining forests annually. 0
        = Most modification; 10= Least.[26]
        Examples of changes in land use include deforestation, intensive monoculture, and urbanization.[27]
        The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services asserts that industrial
        agriculture is the primary driver collapsing biodiversity.[28][21] The UN's Global Biodiversity Outlook 2014
        estimates that 70 percent of the projected loss of terrestrial biodiversity are caused by agriculture use.[needs
        update] Moreover, more than 1/3 of the planet's land surface is utilised for crops and grazing of
        livestock.[29][Link to precise page] Agriculture destroys biodiversity by converting natural habitats to
        intensely managed systems and by releasing pollutants, including greenhouse gases. Food value chains further
        amplify impacts including through energy use, transport and waste.[30] According to a 2020 study published in
        Nature Sustainability, more than 17,000 species are at risk of losing habitat by 2050 as agriculture continues
        to expand to meet future food needs. The researchers suggest that greater agricultural efficiency in the
        developing world and large scale transitions to healthier, Plant-based diets could help reduce habitat loss.[31]
        Similarly, a Chatham House report also posited that a global shift towards largely plant-based diets would free
        up land to allow for the restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity, because in the 2010s over 80% of all global
        farmland was used to rear animals.[32] A 2022 report published in Science concluded that at least 64 million
        square kilometers (24.7 square miles)—44% of terrestrial area—require conservation attention (ranging from
        protected areas to land-use policies) in order to secure important biodiversity areas, ecologically intact
        areas, and optimal locations for representation of species ranges and ecoregions.[33]
        The direct effects of urban growth on habitat loss are well understood: building construction often results in
        habitat destruction and fragmentation. The rise of urbanization greatly reduced biodiversity when large areas of
        natural habitat are fragmented,[34] leading to selection for species that are adapted to urban environments.[35]
        Small habitat patches are unable to support the same level of genetic or taxonomic diversity as they formerly
        could while some of the more sensitive species may become locally extinct.[36] Species abundance populations are
        reduced due to the reduced fragmented area of habitat, this causes an increase of species isolation and forces
        species towards edge habitats and adapt to foraging elsewhere.[34] Human caused habitat fragmentation tends to
        create barriers to dispersal which prevent species from moving with its ideal environment as its shifted by
        climate change.[37] While the negative effects of fragmentation tend to be well known, the risk of fragmentation
        tends to have smaller effects on biodiversity, and can even change and strengthen certain inter-species
        relationships.[38]

    <h3 id="left-align-h-4">Invasive species</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-4">
        Invasive species have major implications on biodiversity loss and have degraded various ecosystems worldwide.
        Invasive species are migrant species that have outcompeted and displaced native species, altered species
        richness and food webs, and changed ecosystems' functions and services.[58][59] According to the Millennium
        Ecosystem Assessment, invasive species are considered one of the top five factors which result in biodiversity
        loss.[60] In the past half century, biological invasions have increased immensely worldwide due to economic
        globalization, resulting in biodiversity loss.[59] Ecosystems that are vulnerable to biological invasions
        include coastal areas, freshwater ecosystems, islands, and places with a Mediterranean climate. One study
        conducted a meta-analysis on the impacts of invasive species on Mediterranean-type ecosystems, and observed a
        significant loss in native species richness.[60] Invasive species are introduced to new habitat, either
        intentionally or unintentionally, by human activities. The most common methods for the introduction of aquatic
        invasive species are by ballast water, on the hulls of ships, and attached to equipment such as fishing
        nets.[61]
        Global warming has changed typical conditions in various environments, allowing greater migration and
        distribution of species dependent on warm climate.[62] This phenomenon could either result in greater
        biodiversity (new species being introduced to new environments), or reduce biodiversity (promotion of invasive
        species). A biological invasion is deemed successful if the invasive species can adapt and survive in the new
        environment, reproduce, disperse, and compete with native communities.[60] Some invasive species are known to
        have high dispersal rates and have major implications on a regional scale. For example, in 2010, muskrat,
        raccoon dog, thrips, and Chinese mitten crab were identified to have affected 20 to 50 regions in Europe.[60]
        Invasive species can become financial burdens for many countries. Due to ecological degradation caused by
        invasive species, this can alter the functionality and reduce the services that ecosystems provide. Additional
        costs are also expected to control the spread of biological invasion, to mitigate further impacts, and to
        restore ecosystems. For example, the cost of damage caused by 79 invasive species between 1906 and 1991 in the
        United States has been estimated at US$120 billion.[60] In China, invasive species have reduced the country's
        gross domestic product (GDP) by 1.36% per year.[63] Management of biological invasion can also be costly. In
        Australia, the expense to monitor, control, manage, and research invasive weed species was approximately
        AU$116.4 million per year, with costs only directed to central and local government.[60] In some situations,
        invasive species may have benefits, such as economic returns. For instance, invasive trees can be logged for
        commercial forestry. However, in most cases, the economic returns are far less than the cost caused by
        biological invasion.[58][60]
        Not only have invasive species caused ecological damage and economical losses, but they can also affect human
        health. With the alteration in ecosystem functionality (due to homogenization of biota communities), invasive
        species have resulted in negative effects on human well-being, which includes reduced resource availability,
        unrestrained spread of human diseases, recreational and educational activities, and tourism.[59][60] With regard
        to human health, alien species have resulted in allergies and skin damage to arise. Other similar diseases that
        invasive species have caused include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), monkey pox, and severe acute
        respiratory syndrome (SARS).[60]

    <h3 id="right-align-h-5">Overexploitation</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-5">
        Due to human dependency and demands, fossil fuel remains the dominant energy source globally; in the United
        States and other countries, approximately 78% of energy production derive from fossil fuels.[25][64] Extraction,
        processing, and burning of fossil fuels indirectly impacts biodiversity loss by contributing to climate change,
        while directly causing habitat destruction and pollution.[25] At fossil fuel extraction sites, land conversion,
        habitat loss and degradation, contamination, and pollution impacts biodiversity beyond terrestrial ecosystems;
        it impacts freshwater, coastal, and marine environments. Once fossil fuels have been extracted, they are
        transported, processed, and refined, which also impacts biodiversity as infrastructure development requires
        removal of habitats, and further pollution is emitted into the environment.[25] For example, the construction of
        roads, well pads, pipelines, reserve pits, evaporation ponds, and power lines leads to habitat fragmentation and
        noise pollution.[64]
        Fossil fuel exploitation tends to occur in areas with high species richness and abundances, usually located in
        coastal and terrestrial environments. In one study, Harfoot and his colleagues identified 181 possible
        "high-risk" areas for fossil fuel exploitation, which were areas that also supported high levels of
        biodiversity. Out of the 181 identified locations, 156 of these high-risk fields were not protected areas,
        indicating that further biodiversity could be lost with fossil fuel exploitation.[25] It is predicted that
        future exploration for fossil fuel will occur in areas with low species richness and rarity, such as the oceans
        and in the Arctic.[citation needed] However, this prediction does not apply to Western Asia, Asia-Pacific,
        Africa, South America, and the Caribbean, where fossil fuel and coal exploitation is expected to occur in areas
        with high species richness.[25][needs update] For example, the Western Amazon (located in Brazil) is known to
        have high biodiversity. However, this region is also threatened by exploitation due to the large quantity of oil
        and natural gas reservoirs.[65] Typically, areas with large fossil fuel reservoirs have a greater likelihood of
        being extracted (based on the country's priorities). This is of concern as tropical environments contain high
        levels of biodiversity, which will indirectly result in greater deforestation for agricultural purposes and
        financial gains (e.g., exporting timber).[65]

    <h3 id="left-align-h-6">Overfishing</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-6">
        Mass fishing of Pacific jack mackerel (with possible bycatch) with a Chilean purse seiner.
        Human demands and consumption have resulted in overfishing, which leads to a loss in biodiversity with reduction
        to fish species richness and abundances.[66] In 2020, global fish abundances have reduced by 38% compared to
        fish population in 1970.[67] Reduction in global fish populations were first noticed during the 1990s.
        Currently, many commercial fishes have been overharvested; approximately 27% of exploited fish stocks in the
        United States are classified overfished.[68] In Tasmania, it was observed that over 50% of major fisheries
        species, such as the eastern gemfish, southern rock lobster, southern bulkefin tuna, jack mackerel, and
        trumpeter, have declined over the past 75 years due to overfishing.[69]
        Fishery methods, such as bottom trawling and longline fishing have caused habitat destruction, resulting spatial
        diversity and regional species richness to decline.[67][70] What these methods cause is an issue of bycatch.[71]
        The problem with bycatch is that there is a lack of reportage done from what species have been caught, a lot of
        the time an unwanted target is caught they are reported as "mixed fish" or are not reported.[70] Unwanted
        species caught within bycatch tend to be released,but it's common that captured fish die while in captivity, or
        die after being released. With an overexploitation of species being removed from their ecosystem, the trophic
        level becomes interrupted which in turn disrupts the food web.Some studies, including the 2019 Intergovernmental
        Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report, found that overfishing is the main driver
        of mass species extinction in the oceans.[72][73] Overfishing has reduced fish and marine mammal biomass by 60%
        since the 1800s,[74] and is currently driving over one-third of sharks and rays to extinction.[75]

        Climate change has adversely affected both terrestrial[76] and marine[77] ecosystems, and is expected to further
        affect many ecosystems, including tundra, mangroves, coral reefs, caves etc.[78] Increasing global temperature,
        more frequent occurrence of extreme weather, and rising sea level are among some of the effects of climate
        change that will have the most significant impact.[79][80] Some of the possible consequences of these effects
        include species decline and extinction, change within ecosystems, increased prevalence of invasive species, a
        shift from forests being carbon sinks to carbon sources, ocean acidification, disruption of the water cycle, and
        increased occurrence of natural disasters, among others

        Alpine flora at Logan Pass, Glacier National Park, in Montana, United States: Alpine plants are one group
        expected to be highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change
        Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local,
        regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the
        term.[81] Climate change is any significant long term change in the expected pattern, whether due to natural
        variability or as a result of human activity. Predicting the effects that climate change will have on plant
        biodiversity can be achieved using various models, however bioclimatic models are most commonly used.[82]
        Environmental conditions play a key role in defining the function and geographic distributions of plants, in
        combination with other factors, thereby modifying patterns of biodiversity.[83] Changes in long term
        environmental conditions that can be collectively coined climate change are known to have had enormous impacts
        on current plant diversity patterns; further impacts are expected in the future.[84] It is predicted that
        climate change will remain one of the major drivers of biodiversity patterns in the future.[85][86][87] Human
        actions are currently triggering the sixth major mass extinction our Earth has seen, changing the distribution
        and abundance of many plants.[88] A 2022 evaluation of vascular plant species suggests that species with no
        major uses in human society are much more likely to go extinct compared to plants actively cultivated for human
        purposes such as agriculture or urban decoration.[89]
        In addition, Pre-species barriers for plants are also the indirect effects of climate change due to human
        activities. First, as mentioned above, the reduction in the number of birds and insects used to help pollinate
        plants[90][91] will reduce the chance of mating between plants. Second, extended fire weather seasons may result
        in more severe burn conditions and shorter burn intervals, which can threaten the biodiversity of native
        vegetation.[92] Besides, species habitat changes or migrations under changing weather conditions can cause
        non-native plants[93] and pest to cause damage to native vegetation diversity, making them less structurally
        functional and more vulnerable to external damage,[94] which would all eventually lead to biodiversity loss.
        Plant and animal populations are interconnected. There are a number of examples in nature that display this
        dependency. Consider pollinator reliant plant species that display an observable sensitivity to pollinator
        activity.[95] A 2007 study looked into the relationship between plant diversity and phenology, experimentally
        determining that plant diversity influenced the broader community flowering time.[95] Flowering time is
        important piece in the pollination puzzle as it impacts the food supply for pollinators.[96] This in turn can
        play a major role in agricultural pursuits [96] and global food security.[97]
        While plants are essential for human survival, they have not received the same attention as the subject of
        conservation efforts as animals.[98] It's estimated that a third of all land plant species are at risk of
        extinction and 94% have yet to be evaluated in terms of their conservation status.[98]Plants existing at the
        lowest trophic level shows a need for an active effort for plant conservation as this will cause all higher
        levels to reduce in biodiversity in tandem with the reduction of plant biodiversity.[99]

        Many scientists have studied the effects of climate change on the community structures and behaviors of aquatic
        macroinvertebrates and microbes – which are the prominent foundation of nutrient cycling in aquatic
        systems.[100] These organisms are responsible for breaking down organic matter into essential carbon and
        nutrients that get cycled throughout the system and maintain health and production of the entire habitat.
        However, there have been numerous studies (through experimental warming) that have shown increases in microbial
        respiration of carbon out of the system, with a simultaneous decrease in leaf litter breakdown caused by
        temperature-sensitive macroinvertebrates.[101] As temperatures are expected to increase largely due to

        functional and more vulnerable to external damage,[94] which would all eventually lead to biodiversity loss.
        Plant and animal populations are interconnected. There are a number of examples in nature that display this
        dependency. Consider pollinator reliant plant species that display an observable sensitivity to pollinator
        activity.[95] A 2007 study looked into the relationship between plant diversity and phenology, experimentally
        determining that plant diversity influenced the broader community flowering time.[95] Flowering time is
        important piece in the pollination puzzle as it impacts the food supply for pollinators.[96] This in turn can
        play a major role in agricultural pursuits [96] and global food security.[97]
        While plants are essential for human survival, they have not received the same attention as the subject of
        conservation efforts as animals.[98] It's estimated that a third of all land plant species are at risk of
        extinction and 94% have yet to be evaluated in terms of their conservation status.[98]Plants existing at the
        lowest trophic level shows a need for an active effort for plant conservation as this will cause all higher
        levels to reduce in biodiversity in tandem with the reduction of plant biodiversity.[99]

        Many scientists have studied the effects of climate change on the community structures and behaviors of aquatic
        macroinvertebrates and microbes – which are the prominent foundation of nutrient cycling in aquatic
        systems.[100] These organisms are responsible for breaking down organic matter into essential carbon and
        nutrients that get cycled throughout the system and maintain health and production of the entire habitat.
        However, there have been numerous studies (through experimental warming) that have shown increases in microbial
        respiration of carbon out of the system, with a simultaneous decrease in leaf litter breakdown caused by
        temperature-sensitive macroinvertebrates.[101] As temperatures are expected to increase largely due to
        anthropogenic influence, the abundance, type, and efficiency of macroinvertebrate and microbial organisms in
        aquatic systems will likely be dramatically altered.

        DPSIR: drivers, pressures, state, impact and response model of intervention
        Major factors for biotic stress and the ensuing accelerating loss rate are, amongst other threats:[102]
        1. Habitat loss and degradation
        Land use intensification (and ensuing land loss/habitat loss) has been identified to be a significant factor in
        loss of ecological services due to direct effects as well as biodiversity loss.[103]
        2. Climate change through heat stress and drought stress
        3. Excessive nutrient load and other forms of pollution
        4. Over-exploitation and unsustainable use (e.g. unsustainable fishing methods) we are currently using 25% more
        natural resources than the planet[clarification needed]
        5. Armed conflict, which disrupts human livelihoods and institutions, contributes to habitat loss, and
        intensifies over-exploitation of economically valuable species, leading to population declines and local
        extinctions.[104]
        6. Invasive alien species that effectively compete for a niche, replacing indigenous species[105]
        7. Drastic increases in the human population have greatly affected the Earth's ability to provide adequate
        resources for all forms of life.[106] Recent IUCN Red List reports indicate that 41% of amphibians, 14% of
        birds, and 26% of mammal species are currently threatened with extinction.[17]
        8. Habitat fragmentation for commercial and agricultural uses (specifically monoculture farming).[107]

        You know, when we first set up WWF, our objective was to save endangered species from extinction. But we have

        The current rate of global diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally
        occurring) background extinction rate, faster than at any other time in human history,[7][8] and expected to
        still grow in the upcoming years.[9][10][11] These rapidly rising extinction trends impacting numerous animal
        groups including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and ray-finned fishes have prompted scientists to declare
        a contemporary biodiversity crisis.[12]
        Locally bounded loss rates can be measured using species richness and its variation over time. Raw counts may
        not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute[clarification needed] abundances. Taking into account
        the relative frequencies, many biodiversity indexes have been developed. Besides richness, evenness and
        heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.[4]
        As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the
        observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity of the subject increases and the
        associated spatial and temporal scales widen."[13] Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split
        up into various scales (e.g. ecosystem diversity vs. habitat diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat
        diversity[13]) or different subcategories (e.g. phylogenetic diversity, species diversity, genetic diversity,
        nucleotide diversity). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer
        observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.[14][15]
        To compare rates between different geographic regions, latitudinal gradients in species diversity should also be
        considered.
        In 2006, many more species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists
        have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized.[16]
        In 2021, about 28 percent of the 134,400 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as
        threatened with extinction—a total of 37,400 species compared to 16,119 threatened species in 2006.[17]
        A 2022 study published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, which surveyed more than 3,000 experts,
        states that "global biodiversity loss and its impacts may be greater than previously thought," and estimates
        that roughly 30% of species "have been globally threatened or driven extinct since the year 1500."[18][19]

        Main articles: Decline in insect populations, Insect biodiversity, Pollinator decline, and The Windshield
        Phenomenon
        In 2017, various publications described the dramatic reduction in absolute insect biomass and number of species
        in Germany and North America over a period of 27 years.[108][109] As possible reasons for the decline, the
        authors highlight neonicotinoids and other agrochemicals. Writing in the journal PLOS One, Hallman et al. (2017)
        conclude that "the widespread insect biomass decline is alarming."[110]
        For example, the critical decline of earthworms (over 80% on average) has been recorded under non-ecological
        agricultural practices.[111] Earthworms play an important role in ecosystem function.[111] For example, they
        help with biological processing in soil, water, and even green house gas balancing.[112] The decline of
        earthworm populations are said to be due to five reasons; soil degradation and destruction of habitat, climate
        change, biological invasion of nonnative species, poor soil management, and pollutant loading.[113] Factors like
        tillage practices and intensive land use decimate the soil and plant roots that earthworms use to create their
        biomass, causing carbon and nitrogen cycles to be impacted negatively. Knowledge of earthworm species diversity
        is quite limited as not even 50% of them have been described. More studies upon earthworms and how they provide
        their ecosystem services must be done to gain a better understanding of going about preserving their
        diversity.[113] With earthworm populations dwindling, this has caused for the Secretariat of the Convention on
        Biological Diversity to take action and promote the restoration and maintenance of the many diverse species of
        earthworms.[113]

        Certain types of pesticide, neonicotinoids, probably contribute to the decline of certain bird species.[114] A
        study funded by BirdLife International confirms that 51 species of birds are critically endangered and 8 could
        be classified as extinct or in danger of extinction. Nearly 30% of extinction is due to hunting and trapping for
        the exotic pet trade. Deforestation, caused by unsustainable logging and agriculture, could be the next
        extinction driver, because birds lose their habitat and their food. The biologist Luisa Arnedo said: "as soon as
        the habitat is gone, they're gone too".[115]
        Within the Amazon rainforest there is an area called Bele´m and it is an area of endemism. In Bele´m 76% of the
        land has already been stripped of its natural resources, including the trees of the forest.[116] Within the area
        bird species are strongly affected by the deforestation, due to being put in that situation 56% of the birds are
        now in danger of going into extinction. With the climate changing as well as their habitat, the population of
        the birds will continue to decline. Even with protected areas of land, the efficiency in which birds are
        conserved are low.[116]
        Modern bird hunting and trapping is a common practice in South America. Some cultures in Brazil encourage bird
        hunting and trapping for commercial reasons. Some reasons include, selling the wild birds as pets, breeding the
        birds and selling the young, selling the birds for food, and selling them for religious and medicinal
        purposes.[117]
        Another increasingly abundant threat to bird populations is collisions and electrocutions due to power
        lines.[118] Migratory species are at a higher risk of collision accidents and up to 1 billion birds are killed
        due to colliding with buildings each year in the United States.[119]

        Freshwater ecosystems ranging from swamps, deltas, to rivers make up to 1% of earths surface. Although making up
        such little proportion of the earth, freshwater ecosystems are important because these kind of habitats are home
        to approximately one third of vertebrate species.[120] Freshwater species are beginning to decline at twice the
        rate of other species such as those located on land or within the ocean, this rapid loss has already placed 27%
        of 29,500 species dependent on freshwater upon the IUCN Red List.[120] With freshwater species declining so
        quickly, it is due to the poor systems in place that don't provide any protection to their biodiversity.
        A study by 16 global conservation organizations found that the biodiversity crisis is most acute in freshwater
        ecosystems, with a rate of decline double that of oceans and forests. Global populations of freshwater fish are
        collapsing from anthropogenic impacts such as pollution and overfishing. Migratory fish populations have

        Marine biodiversity encompasses any living organism which resides in the ocean, and describes various complex
        relationships within marine ecosystems.[68] On a local and regional scale, marine communities are better
        understood compared to marine ecosystems on a global scale. In 2018, it was estimated that approximately 240,000
        marine species have been documented.[67] Based on this prediction, the discovery of total marine species ranges
        between 11% to 78% due to uncertainties regarding global marine biodiversity.[67] However, the number of
        described marine species remains low compared to terrestrial species due to various factors, which includes the
        assignment of different names for the same species, and insufficient taxa classification.[68] It is likely that
        many undocumented species have already disappeared. Because not all marine species have been described, it is
        difficult to provide an accurate estimate of global extinction in marine ecosystems. As a result, abundances of
        marine species remain uncertain, with estimates ranging between 178,000 and 10 million oceanic species.[68]
        With anthropogenic pressure, this results in human activities having the strongest influences on marine
        biodiversity, with main drivers of global extinction being habitat loss, pollution, invasive species, and
        overexploitation.[123][124] Greater pressure is placed on marine ecosystems with human settlements near coastal
        areas.[125] Other indirect factors that have resulted in marine species to decline include climate change and
        change to oceanic biochemistry.[123]
        Overexploitation has resulted in the extinction of over 20 described marine species, which includes seabirds,
        marine mammals, algae, and fishes.[68] Examples of extinct marine species include the Steller's sea cow
        (Hydrodamalis gigas) and the Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis). However, not all extinctions are because
        of humans. For example, in 1930, the eelgrass limpet (Lottia alveus) became extinct once the Zostera marina
        seagrass population declined upon exposure to a disease. The Lottia alveus were greatly impacted as the Zostera
        marina were their sole habitats.[68]

        Biodiversity loss also threatens the structure and proper functioning of the ecosystem. Although all ecosystems
        are able to adapt to the stresses associated with reductions in biodiversity to some degree, biodiversity loss
        reduces an ecosystem's complexity, as roles once played by multiple interacting species or multiple interacting
        individuals are played by fewer or none.[42] The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the
        mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and
        pathways of potential community change. At higher levels of extinction (40 to 60 percent of species), the
        effects of species loss ranked with those of many other major drivers of environmental change, such as ozone
        pollution, acid deposition on forests and nutrient pollution.[126] Finally, the effects are also seen on human
        needs such as clean water, air and food production over-time. For example, studies over the last two
        decades[when?] have demonstrated that more biologically diverse ecosystems are more productive.[127] As a
        result, there has been growing concern that the very high rates of modern extinctions – due to habitat loss,
        overharvesting and other human-caused environmental changes – could reduce nature's ability to provide goods and
        services like food, clean water and a stable climate.[128]
        An October 2020 analysis by Swiss Re found that one-fifth of all countries are at risk of ecosystem collapse as
        the result of anthropogenic habitat destruction and increased wildlife loss.[129]

        An infographic describing the relationship between biodiversity and food.
        In 2019, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization produced its first report on The State of the World's
        Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, which warned that "Many key components of biodiversity for food and
        agriculture at genetic, species and ecosystem levels are in decline."[130][131] The report states that this is
        being caused by "a variety of drivers operating at a range of levels" and more specifically that "major global
        trends such as changes in climate, international markets and demography give rise to more immediate drivers such
        as land-use change, pollution and overuse of external inputs, overharvesting and the proliferation of invasive
        species. Interactions between drivers often exacerbate their effects on biodiversity for food and agriculture
        (BFA). Demographic changes, urbanization, markets, trade and consumer preferences are reported [by the countries
        that provided inputs to the report] to have a strong influence on food systems, frequently with negative
        consequences for BFA and the ecosystem services it provides. However, such drivers are also reported to open
        opportunities to make food systems more sustainable, for example through the development of markets for
        biodiversity-friendly products."[132] It further states that "the driver mentioned by the highest number of
        countries as having negative effects on regulating and supporting ecosystem services [in food and agricultural
        production systems] is changes in land and water use and management" and that "loss and degradation of forest
        and aquatic ecosystems and, in many production systems, transition to intensive production of a reduced number
        of species, breeds and varieties, remain major drivers of loss of BFA and ecosystem services."[132]
        The health of humans is largely dependent on the product of an ecosystem. With biodiversity loss, a huge impact
        on human health comes as well. Biodiversity makes it possible for humans to have a sustainable level of soils
        and the means to have the genetic factors to have food.[133]
        Many activists and scholars have suggested that there is a connection between plant patent protection and the
        loss of crop biodiversity,[134] although such claims are contested.[135]

        The decrease in biodiversity has several implications for human health. One such implication is the loss of
        medicinal plants. The use of plants for medicinal purposes is extensive, with ~70 to 80% of individuals
        worldwide relying solely on plant-based medicine as their primary source of healthcare.[136] This dependency on
        plants for medicinal purposes is especially rife in developing countries.[136] Local knowledge surrounding
        medicinal plants is useful for screening for new herbal medicines that may be useful for treating disease.[137]
        Villages and communities which reside continually in a single geographic area over time, create, transmit and
        apply widespread information surrounding the medicinal resources in the area.[137] Formal scientific methods
        have been useful in identifying the active ingredients used in ethnopharmacy and applying them to modern
        medicines. However, it is important that medicinal resources are managed appropriately as they become globally
        traded in order to prevent species endangerment.[137] Changes to local ecosystems (such as access to food and
        clean water) can indirectly impact the local economy, and society (livihood and social interaction between
        people living in the impacted area). Therefore impacting the health of the people.[138]

        According to the biodiversity hypothesis, reduced contact of people with natural environment and biodiversity
        may adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. The hypothesis is based
        on the observation that two dominant socio-ecological trends – the loss of biodiversity and increasing incidence
        of inflammatory diseases – are interconnected.[139][140][141]
        Urbanization and fragmentation of habitats increasingly lead to loss of connection between human and natural
        environment. Furthermore, immunological non-communicable diseases have become increasingly common in recent
        decades especially in urbanized communities.[142]

        There are so many conservation challenges when dealing with biodiversity loss that a joint effort needs to be
        made through public policies, economic solutions, monitoring and education by governments, NGOs,
        conservationists etc.[143] Incentives are required to protect species and conserve their natural habitat and
        disincentivize habitat loss and degradation (e.g. implementing sustainable development including targets of SDG
        15). Other ways to achieve this goal are enforcing laws that prevent poaching wildlife, protect species from
        overhunting and overfishing and keep the ecosystems they rely on intact and secure from species invasions and
        land use conversion.[144] Furthermore, conservation based models like the Global Safety Net are continuously
        being developed to consider the ecological connections that need to be addressed to effectively mitigate
        biodiversity loss.[145] According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
        Services (IPBES) action to protect biodiversity is very cost effective because it reduces the risk of pandemics
        due to pathogens from wildlife.[146]
        Conservationists and sustainable research scientists around the world have also developed systems-based
        approaches to help mitigate biodiversity loss. This methodology allows scientists to create contextual
        frameworks that consider the many nuances and linkages of environmental conservation like ecological footprints,
        planetary boundaries, ecological economics, etc.[147] Considering all the many ways in which the natural and
        human world intersect can help researchers understand the intricacies that lead to biodiversity loss and find
        patterns that can be applied to similar situations. One example of these type of frameworks is the triple bottom
        line, which has been adopted by many businesses and organizations to evaluate their impact and progress towards
        the marriage of social, environmental, and economic success.

        The public has a really strong sense of the climate crisis and that’s driving politics, certainly in the EU, but
        probably globally as well. It’s so manifest, the climate crisis, that it’s inevitable that it will need to be
        addressed by political leaders. The biodiversity crisis is not that manifest to many of our citizens.
        — Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission[148]

        Earth's 25 terrestrial hot spots of biodiversity. These regions contain a number of plant and animal species and
        have been subjected to high levels of habitat destruction by human activity.
        There are many organizations devoted to the cause of prioritizing conservation efforts such as the Red List of
        Threatened Species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the
        United States Endangered Species Act. British environmental scientist Norman Myers and his colleagues have
        identified 25 terrestrial biodiversity hotspots that could serve as priorities for habitat protection.[149]
        Many governments in the world have conserved portions of their territories under the Convention on Biological
        Diversity (CBD), a multilateral treaty signed in 1992–3. The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, part of the CBD's
        Strategic Plan 2011–2020, were published in 2010.[150] Since 2010, approximately 164 countries have developed
        plans to reach their conservation targets, including the protection of 17 percent of terrestrial and inland
        waters and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas.[citation needed]
        In 2019 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an
        international organization formed to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
        (IPCC),[151] published the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services which said that up to
        a million plant and animal species are facing extinction because of human activities.[144][21] An October 2020
        report by IPBES stated that the same human activities which are the underlying drivers of climate change and
        biodiversity loss, such as the destruction of wildlife and wild habitats, are also the same drivers of
        pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.[152] In 2022, IPBES listed some of the primary drivers of the
        contemporary extinction crisis as being unsustainable fishing, hunting and logging.[153]
        According to the 2020 United Nations' Global Biodiversity Outlook report, of the 20 biodiversity goals laid out
        by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, only 6 were "partially achieved" by the deadline of 2020.[154] The
        report highlighted that if the status quo is not changed, biodiversity will continue to decline due to
        "currently unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, population growth and technological
        developments".[155] The report also singled out Australia, Brazil and Cameroon and the Galapagos Islands
        (Ecuador) for having had one of its animals lost to extinction in the past 10 years.[156] Following this, the
        leaders of 64 nations and the European Union pledged to halt environmental degradation and restore the natural
        world. Leaders from some of the world's biggest polluters, namely China, India, Russia, Brazil and the United
        States, were not among them.[157] Some experts contend that the refusal of the United States to ratify the
        Convention on Biological Diversity is harming global efforts to halt the extinction crisis.[158] Top scientists
        say that even if the 2010 targets had been met, it likely would not have resulted in any substantive reductions
        of current extinction rates.[23][1] Others have raised concerns that the Convention on Biological Diversity does
        not go far enough, and argue the goal should be zero extinctions by 2050, along with cutting the impact of
        unsustainable food production on nature by half. That the targets are not legally binding has also been subject
        to criticism.[159]
        In 2020, with passing of the 2020 target date for the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, scientists proposed a
        measurable, near-term biodiversity target – comparable to the below 2 °C global warming target – of keeping
        described species extinctions to well below 20 per year over the next 100 years across all major groups (fungi,
        plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates) and across all ecosystem types (marine, freshwater, and
        terrestrial).[160]
        A 2021 collaborative report by scientists from the IPBES and the IPCC says that biodiversity loss and climate
        change must be addressed simultaneously, as they are inexorably linked and have similar effects on human
        well-being. Pamela McElwee, human ecologist and co-author of the report, says "climate has simply gotten more
        attention because people are increasingly feeling it in their own lives – whether it's wildfires or hurricane
        risk. Our report points out that biodiversity loss has that similar effect on human wellbeing."
