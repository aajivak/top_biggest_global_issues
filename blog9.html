        Through its unique capacities as the world’s premiere vehicle for international cooperation, the UN system plays a crucial role in coordinating assistance of all kinds — to help Africa help itself. From promoting the development of democratic institutions, to establishing peace between warring nations, the UN is present on the ground supporting economic and social development and the promotion and protection of human rights.

        In this effort, the UN works closely with Africa’s regional cooperation mechanisms and has six active peacekeeping operations at present. UN peacekeepers serve in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Mali, Western Sahara, South Sudan and Sudan - one mission in Darfur (with the African Union) and one in the disputed Abyei area.
        
        To advance its support for Africa even further, the United Nations Office of the Special Adviser on Africa was established in 2003 to enhance international support for African development and security and to improve coordination of UN system support. It also works to facilitate global deliberations on Africa, particularly with respect to the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) — a strategic framework adopted by African leaders in 2001. In 2019, NEPAD's mandate was reformed. It is now serving as the first development agency of the African Union.
        
        Africa Day is an annual commemoration of the establishment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on May 25, 1963. On that day 32 independent African states signed the founding charter in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 2002, the OAU became the African Union. Africa Day is celebrated around the world.

    <h3 id="right-align-h-2">Climate Change</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-2">
        Climate change poses a significant threat to economic, social and environmental development in Africa. There is strong evidence that warming in Africa has increased significantly over the past 50 to 100 years, with clear effects on the health, livelihoods and food security of people in Africa. Climate change is likely to lessen crop yields, increase water scarcity, aggravate biodiversity loss and contribute to desertification, hence imposing a severe challenge on the continent.

    <h3 id="left-align-h-3">Hunger and malnutrition</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-3">
        The number of persons suffering from hunger continues to rise, particularly in 2019-2020.  The worsening of the state of food security and nutrition in Africa is spurred on mainly by conflicts, climate change and economic slowdowns following the COVID-19 pandemic.

        The 2021 report, entitled "Africa, Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition," published by the African Union Commission, FAO and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, calls for all of the continent's countries to transform the food industry. Countries will need to invest in agriculture and related sectors, as well as in water, health, and in education services to reduce vulnerabilities and build capacities to withstand shocks.
        
        In 2020, 281.6 million of Africans suffered from hunger. According to the report, the numbers vary across the subregions; the number of undernourished people reaches about 44% in Eastern Africa, 27% in Western Africa, 20% in Central Africa, 6,2% in Northern Africa and 2,4% in Southern Africa.

    <h3 id="right-align-h-4">Ebola</h3>
    <p id="right-align-p-4">
        On 23 March 2014 WHO’s African Regional Office reported an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea. It has quickly spread to other countries in West Africa. The outbreak has been the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has destroyed lives, decimated communities, and orphaned children in the affected countries. More than 11,000 people have died of the disease. The epidemic has slowed down economic growth and closed businesses, affecting the livelihood of millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the region. As part of the response, on 19th September 2014, the international community established the first ever emergency health mission the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. The mission closed on 31 July 2015, having achieved its core objective of scaling up the response on the ground
        Addressing the challenges posed by protracted conflicts and longstanding disputes on the African continent has been a major focus for the UN. In 1960 the first peacekeeping operation in Africa was deployed in the Republic of the Congo to ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces and to assist the Government in maintaining law and order.

Since then thousands of peacekeepers have been deployed in more than 30 peacekeeping operations to African countries, including Angola, Mozambique, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Burundi and Sudan. The latest peacekeeping mission was established in 2014 in the Central African Republic.

    <!-- <h3 id="left-align-h-4">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</h3>
    <p id="left-align-p-4">
        The UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to "prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of Rwanda and neighbouring States in 1994". During its operation, the Tribunal indicted 93 individuals including high-ranking military and government officials, politicians, businessmen, as well as religious, militia, and media leaders.

        With its sister international tribunals and courts, the ICTR has played a pioneering role in the establishment of a credible international criminal justice system, producing a substantial body of jurisprudence on genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, as well as forms of individual and superior responsibility.
        
        The ICTR is the first ever international tribunal to deliver verdicts in relation to genocide, and the first to interpret the definition of genocide set forth in the 1948 Geneva Conventions. It is also the first international tribunal to define rape in international criminal law and to recognise rape as a means of perpetrating genocide, as well as the first international tribunal to hold members of the media responsible for broadcasts intended to inflame the public to commit acts of genocide.
        
        The ICTR delivered its last trial judgement in December 2012. Since then the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals has assumed responsibility for the ICTR's residual functions including cases before the appeals chamber and the tracking and arrest of the accused who remain fugitives from justice.

    <p id="right-align-p-5">
        The continent's economy grew by roughly 3.4 percent in 2019, creating one of the longest stretches of uninterrupted positive economic expansion in Africa's history. As a result, a growing number of Africans have joined the middle class each year. However, in 2020, Africa experienced a 3.4 percent contraction in GDP. The country is expected to achieve a modest recover in 2021, predicted on the increase of export and commodity prices and the rise of domestic demand.

    <p id="left-align-p-6">
        Mass fishing of Pacific jack mackerel (with possible bycatch) with a Chilean purse seiner.
        Human demands and consumption have resulted in overfishing, which leads to a loss in biodiversity with reduction
        to fish species richness and abundances.[66] In 2020, global fish abundances have reduced by 38% compared to
        fish population in 1970.[67] Reduction in global fish populations were first noticed during the 1990s.
        Currently, many commercial fishes have been overharvested; approximately 27% of exploited fish stocks in the
        United States are classified overfished.[68] In Tasmania, it was observed that over 50% of major fisheries
        species, such as the eastern gemfish, southern rock lobster, southern bulkefin tuna, jack mackerel, and
        trumpeter, have declined over the past 75 years due to overfishing.[69]
        Fishery methods, such as bottom trawling and longline fishing have caused habitat destruction, resulting spatial
        diversity and regional species richness to decline.[67][70] What these methods cause is an issue of bycatch.[71]
        The problem with bycatch is that there is a lack of reportage done from what species have been caught, a lot of
        the time an unwanted target is caught they are reported as "mixed fish" or are not reported.[70] Unwanted
        species caught within bycatch tend to be released,but it's common that captured fish die while in captivity, or
        die after being released. With an overexploitation of species being removed from their ecosystem, the trophic
        level becomes interrupted which in turn disrupts the food web.Some studies, including the 2019 Intergovernmental
        Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report, found that overfishing is the main driver
        of mass species extinction in the oceans.[72][73] Overfishing has reduced fish and marine mammal biomass by 60%
        since the 1800s,[74] and is currently driving over one-third of sharks and rays to extinction.[75]

        Climate change has adversely affected both terrestrial[76] and marine[77] ecosystems, and is expected to further
        affect many ecosystems, including tundra, mangroves, coral reefs, caves etc.[78] Increasing global temperature,
        more frequent occurrence of extreme weather, and rising sea level are among some of the effects of climate
        change that will have the most significant impact.[79][80] Some of the possible consequences of these effects
        include species decline and extinction, change within ecosystems, increased prevalence of invasive species, a
        shift from forests being carbon sinks to carbon sources, ocean acidification, disruption of the water cycle, and
        increased occurrence of natural disasters, among others

        Alpine flora at Logan Pass, Glacier National Park, in Montana, United States: Alpine plants are one group
        expected to be highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change
        Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local,
        regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the
        term.[81] Climate change is any significant long term change in the expected pattern, whether due to natural
        variability or as a result of human activity. Predicting the effects that climate change will have on plant
        biodiversity can be achieved using various models, however bioclimatic models are most commonly used.[82]
        Environmental conditions play a key role in defining the function and geographic distributions of plants, in
        combination with other factors, thereby modifying patterns of biodiversity.[83] Changes in long term
        environmental conditions that can be collectively coined climate change are known to have had enormous impacts
        on current plant diversity patterns; further impacts are expected in the future.[84] It is predicted that
        climate change will remain one of the major drivers of biodiversity patterns in the future.[85][86][87] Human
        actions are currently triggering the sixth major mass extinction our Earth has seen, changing the distribution
        and abundance of many plants.[88] A 2022 evaluation of vascular plant species suggests that species with no
        major uses in human society are much more likely to go extinct compared to plants actively cultivated for human
        purposes such as agriculture or urban decoration.[89]
        In addition, Pre-species barriers for plants are also the indirect effects of climate change due to human
        activities. First, as mentioned above, the reduction in the number of birds and insects used to help pollinate
        plants[90][91] will reduce the chance of mating between plants. Second, extended fire weather seasons may result
        in more severe burn conditions and shorter burn intervals, which can threaten the biodiversity of native
        vegetation.[92] Besides, species habitat changes or migrations under changing weather conditions can cause
        non-native plants[93] and pest to cause damage to native vegetation diversity, making them less structurally
        functional and more vulnerable to external damage,[94] which would all eventually lead to biodiversity loss.
        Plant and animal populations are interconnected. There are a number of examples in nature that display this
        dependency. Consider pollinator reliant plant species that display an observable sensitivity to pollinator
        activity.[95] A 2007 study looked into the relationship between plant diversity and phenology, experimentally
        determining that plant diversity influenced the broader community flowering time.[95] Flowering time is
        important piece in the pollination puzzle as it impacts the food supply for pollinators.[96] This in turn can
        play a major role in agricultural pursuits [96] and global food security.[97]
        While plants are essential for human survival, they have not received the same attention as the subject of
        conservation efforts as animals.[98] It's estimated that a third of all land plant species are at risk of
        extinction and 94% have yet to be evaluated in terms of their conservation status.[98]Plants existing at the
        lowest trophic level shows a need for an active effort for plant conservation as this will cause all higher
        levels to reduce in biodiversity in tandem with the reduction of plant biodiversity.[99]

        Major factors for biotic stress and the ensuing accelerating loss rate are, amongst other threats:[102]
        1. Habitat loss and degradation
        Land use intensification (and ensuing land loss/habitat loss) has been identified to be a significant factor in
        loss of ecological services due to direct effects as well as biodiversity loss.[103]
        2. Climate change through heat stress and drought stress
        3. Excessive nutrient load and other forms of pollution
        4. Over-exploitation and unsustainable use (e.g. unsustainable fishing methods) we are currently using 25% more
        natural resources than the planet[clarification needed]
        5. Armed conflict, which disrupts human livelihoods and institutions, contributes to habitat loss, and
        intensifies over-exploitation of economically valuable species, leading to population declines and local
        extinctions.[104]
        6. Invasive alien species that effectively compete for a niche, replacing indigenous species[105]
        7. Drastic increases in the human population have greatly affected the Earth's ability to provide adequate
        resources for all forms of life.[106] Recent IUCN Red List reports indicate that 41% of amphibians, 14% of

        Demonstrator against biodiversity loss, at Extinction Rebellion (2018).
        You know, when we first set up WWF, our objective was to save endangered species from extinction. But we have
        failed completely; we haven't managed to save a single one. If only we had put all that money into condoms, we
        might have done some good.
        — Sir Peter Scott, Founder of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Cosmos Magazine, 2010[6]
        The current rate of global diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally
        occurring) background extinction rate, faster than at any other time in human history,[7][8] and expected to
        still grow in the upcoming years.[9][10][11] These rapidly rising extinction trends impacting numerous animal
        groups including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and ray-finned fishes have prompted scientists to declare
        a contemporary biodiversity crisis.[12]
        Locally bounded loss rates can be measured using species richness and its variation over time. Raw counts may
        not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute[clarification needed] abundances. Taking into account
        the relative frequencies, many biodiversity indexes have been developed. Besides richness, evenness and
        heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.[4]
        As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the
        observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity of the subject increases and the
        associated spatial and temporal scales widen."[13] Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split
        up into various scales (e.g. ecosystem diversity vs. habitat diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat
        diversity[13]) or different subcategories (e.g. phylogenetic diversity, species diversity, genetic diversity,
        nucleotide diversity). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer
        observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.[14][15]
        To compare rates between different geographic regions, latitudinal gradients in species diversity should also be
        considered.
        In 2006, many more species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists
        have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized.[16]
        In 2021, about 28 percent of the 134,400 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as
        threatened with extinction—a total of 37,400 species compared to 16,119 threatened species in 2006.[17]
        A 2022 study published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, which surveyed more than 3,000 experts,
        states that "global biodiversity loss and its impacts may be greater than previously thought," and estimates
        that roughly 30% of species "have been globally threatened or driven extinct since the year 1500."[18][19]

        Main articles: Decline in insect populations, Insect biodiversity, Pollinator decline, and The Windshield
        Phenomenon
        In 2017, various publications described the dramatic reduction in absolute insect biomass and number of species
        in Germany and North America over a period of 27 years.[108][109] As possible reasons for the decline, the
        authors highlight neonicotinoids and other agrochemicals. Writing in the journal PLOS One, Hallman et al. (2017)
        conclude that "the widespread insect biomass decline is alarming."[110]
        For example, the critical decline of earthworms (over 80% on average) has been recorded under non-ecological
        agricultural practices.[111] Earthworms play an important role in ecosystem function.[111] For example, they
        help with biological processing in soil, water, and even green house gas balancing.[112] The decline of
        earthworm populations are said to be due to five reasons; soil degradation and destruction of habitat, climate
        change, biological invasion of nonnative species, poor soil management, and pollutant loading.[113] Factors like
        tillage practices and intensive land use decimate the soil and plant roots that earthworms use to create their
        biomass, causing carbon and nitrogen cycles to be impacted negatively. Knowledge of earthworm species diversity
        is quite limited as not even 50% of them have been described. More studies upon earthworms and how they provide
        their ecosystem services must be done to gain a better understanding of going about preserving their
        diversity.[113] With earthworm populations dwindling, this has caused for the Secretariat of the Convention on
        Biological Diversity to take action and promote the restoration and maintenance of the many diverse species of
        earthworms.[113]

        You know, when we first set up WWF, our objective was to save endangered species from extinction. But we have
        failed completely; we haven't managed to save a single one. If only we had put all that money into condoms, we
        might have done some good.
        — Sir Peter Scott, Founder of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Cosmos Magazine, 2010[6]
        The current rate of global diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally
        occurring) background extinction rate, faster than at any other time in human history,[7][8] and expected to
        still grow in the upcoming years.[9][10][11] These rapidly rising extinction trends impacting numerous animal
        groups including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and ray-finned fishes have prompted scientists to declare
        a contemporary biodiversity crisis.[12]
        Locally bounded loss rates can be measured using species richness and its variation over time. Raw counts may
        not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute[clarification needed] abundances. Taking into account
        the relative frequencies, many biodiversity indexes have been developed. Besides richness, evenness and
        heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.[4]
        As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the
        observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity of the subject increases and the
        associated spatial and temporal scales widen."[13] Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split
        up into various scales (e.g. ecosystem diversity vs. habitat diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat
        diversity[13]) or different subcategories (e.g. phylogenetic diversity, species diversity, genetic diversity,
        nucleotide diversity). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer
        observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.[14][15]
        To compare rates between different geographic regions, latitudinal gradients in species diversity should also be
        considered.
        In 2006, many more species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists
        have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized.[16]
        In 2021, about 28 percent of the 134,400 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as
        threatened with extinction—a total of 37,400 species compared to 16,119 threatened species in 2006.[17]
        A 2022 study published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, which surveyed more than 3,000 experts,
        states that "global biodiversity loss and its impacts may be greater than previously thought," and estimates
        that roughly 30% of species "have been globally threatened or driven extinct since the year 1500."[18][19]

        Certain types of pesticide, neonicotinoids, probably contribute to the decline of certain bird species.[114] A
        study funded by BirdLife International confirms that 51 species of birds are critically endangered and 8 could
        be classified as extinct or in danger of extinction. Nearly 30% of extinction is due to hunting and trapping for
        the exotic pet trade. Deforestation, caused by unsustainable logging and agriculture, could be the next
        extinction driver, because birds lose their habitat and their food. The biologist Luisa Arnedo said: "as soon as
        the habitat is gone, they're gone too".[115]
        Within the Amazon rainforest there is an area called Bele´m and it is an area of endemism. In Bele´m 76% of the
        land has already been stripped of its natural resources, including the trees of the forest.[116] Within the area
        bird species are strongly affected by the deforestation, due to being put in that situation 56% of the birds are
        now in danger of going into extinction. With the climate changing as well as their habitat, the population of
        the birds will continue to decline. Even with protected areas of land, the efficiency in which birds are
        conserved are low.[116]
        Modern bird hunting and trapping is a common practice in South America. Some cultures in Brazil encourage bird
        hunting and trapping for commercial reasons. Some reasons include, selling the wild birds as pets, breeding the
        birds and selling the young, selling the birds for food, and selling them for religious and medicinal
        purposes.[117]
        Another increasingly abundant threat to bird populations is collisions and electrocutions due to power
        lines.[118] Migratory species are at a higher risk of collision accidents and up to 1 billion birds are killed
        due to colliding with buildings each year in the United States.[119]

        Freshwater ecosystems ranging from swamps, deltas, to rivers make up to 1% of earths surface. Although making up
        such little proportion of the earth, freshwater ecosystems are important because these kind of habitats are home
        to approximately one third of vertebrate species.[120] Freshwater species are beginning to decline at twice the
        rate of other species such as those located on land or within the ocean, this rapid loss has already placed 27%
        of 29,500 species dependent on freshwater upon the IUCN Red List.[120] With freshwater species declining so
        quickly, it is due to the poor systems in place that don't provide any protection to their biodiversity.
        A study by 16 global conservation organizations found that the biodiversity crisis is most acute in freshwater
        ecosystems, with a rate of decline double that of oceans and forests. Global populations of freshwater fish are
        collapsing from anthropogenic impacts such as pollution and overfishing. Migratory fish populations have
        declined by 76% since 1970, and large "megafish" populations have fallen by 94% with 16 species declared extinct
        in 2020.[121]

        Humans have altered plant richness in regional landscapes worldwide, transforming more than 75% of the
        terrestrial biomes to "anthropogenic biomes." This is seen through loss of native species being replaced and out

        Marine biodiversity encompasses any living organism which resides in the ocean, and describes various complex
        relationships within marine ecosystems.[68] On a local and regional scale, marine communities are better
        understood compared to marine ecosystems on a global scale. In 2018, it was estimated that approximately 240,000
        marine species have been documented.[67] Based on this prediction, the discovery of total marine species ranges
        between 11% to 78% due to uncertainties regarding global marine biodiversity.[67] However, the number of
        described marine species remains low compared to terrestrial species due to various factors, which includes the
        assignment of different names for the same species, and insufficient taxa classification.[68] It is likely that
        many undocumented species have already disappeared. Because not all marine species have been described, it is
        difficult to provide an accurate estimate of global extinction in marine ecosystems. As a result, abundances of
        marine species remain uncertain, with estimates ranging between 178,000 and 10 million oceanic species.[68]
        With anthropogenic pressure, this results in human activities having the strongest influences on marine
        biodiversity, with main drivers of global extinction being habitat loss, pollution, invasive species, and
        overexploitation.[123][124] Greater pressure is placed on marine ecosystems with human settlements near coastal
        areas.[125] Other indirect factors that have resulted in marine species to decline include climate change and
        change to oceanic biochemistry.[123]
        Overexploitation has resulted in the extinction of over 20 described marine species, which includes seabirds,
        marine mammals, algae, and fishes.[68] Examples of extinct marine species include the Steller's sea cow
        (Hydrodamalis gigas) and the Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis). However, not all extinctions are because
        of humans. For example, in 1930, the eelgrass limpet (Lottia alveus) became extinct once the Zostera marina
        seagrass population declined upon exposure to a disease. The Lottia alveus were greatly impacted as the Zostera
        marina were their sole habitats.[68]

        Biodiversity loss also threatens the structure and proper functioning of the ecosystem. Although all ecosystems
        are able to adapt to the stresses associated with reductions in biodiversity to some degree, biodiversity loss
        reduces an ecosystem's complexity, as roles once played by multiple interacting species or multiple interacting
        individuals are played by fewer or none.[42] The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the
        mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and
        pathways of potential community change. At higher levels of extinction (40 to 60 percent of species), the
        effects of species loss ranked with those of many other major drivers of environmental change, such as ozone
        pollution, acid deposition on forests and nutrient pollution.[126] Finally, the effects are also seen on human
        needs such as clean water, air and food production over-time. For example, studies over the last two
        decades[when?] have demonstrated that more biologically diverse ecosystems are more productive.[127] As a
        result, there has been growing concern that the very high rates of modern extinctions – due to habitat loss,
        overharvesting and other human-caused environmental changes – could reduce nature's ability to provide goods and
        services like food, clean water and a stable climate.[128]
        An October 2020 analysis by Swiss Re found that one-fifth of all countries are at risk of ecosystem collapse as
        the result of anthropogenic habitat destruction and increased wildlife loss.[129]

        An infographic describing the relationship between biodiversity and food.
        In 2019, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization produced its first report on The State of the World's
        Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, which warned that "Many key components of biodiversity for food and
        agriculture at genetic, species and ecosystem levels are in decline."[130][131] The report states that this is
        being caused by "a variety of drivers operating at a range of levels" and more specifically that "major global
        trends such as changes in climate, international markets and demography give rise to more immediate drivers such
        as land-use change, pollution and overuse of external inputs, overharvesting and the proliferation of invasive
        species. Interactions between drivers often exacerbate their effects on biodiversity for food and agriculture
        (BFA). Demographic changes, urbanization, markets, trade and consumer preferences are reported [by the countries
        that provided inputs to the report] to have a strong influence on food systems, frequently with negative
        consequences for BFA and the ecosystem services it provides. However, such drivers are also reported to open
        opportunities to make food systems more sustainable, for example through the development of markets for
        biodiversity-friendly products."[132] It further states that "the driver mentioned by the highest number of
        countries as having negative effects on regulating and supporting ecosystem services [in food and agricultural
        production systems] is changes in land and water use and management" and that "loss and degradation of forest
        and aquatic ecosystems and, in many production systems, transition to intensive production of a reduced number
        of species, breeds and varieties, remain major drivers of loss of BFA and ecosystem services."[132]
        The health of humans is largely dependent on the product of an ecosystem. With biodiversity loss, a huge impact
        on human health comes as well. Biodiversity makes it possible for humans to have a sustainable level of soils
        and the means to have the genetic factors to have food.[133]
        Many activists and scholars have suggested that there is a connection between plant patent protection and the
        loss of crop biodiversity,[134] although such claims are contested.[135]

        The decrease in biodiversity has several implications for human health. One such implication is the loss of
        medicinal plants. The use of plants for medicinal purposes is extensive, with ~70 to 80% of individuals
        worldwide relying solely on plant-based medicine as their primary source of healthcare.[136] This dependency on
        plants for medicinal purposes is especially rife in developing countries.[136] Local knowledge surrounding
        medicinal plants is useful for screening for new herbal medicines that may be useful for treating disease.[137]
        Villages and communities which reside continually in a single geographic area over time, create, transmit and
        apply widespread information surrounding the medicinal resources in the area.[137] Formal scientific methods
        have been useful in identifying the active ingredients used in ethnopharmacy and applying them to modern
        medicines. However, it is important that medicinal resources are managed appropriately as they become globally
        traded in order to prevent species endangerment.[137] Changes to local ecosystems (such as access to food and
        clean water) can indirectly impact the local economy, and society (livihood and social interaction between
        people living in the impacted area). Therefore impacting the health of the people.[138]
        This section is an excerpt from Biodiversity hypothesis of health.[edit]

        Diagram of biodiversity hypothesis[139]
        According to the biodiversity hypothesis, reduced contact of people with natural environment and biodiversity
        may adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. The hypothesis is based
        on the observation that two dominant socio-ecological trends – the loss of biodiversity and increasing incidence
        of inflammatory diseases – are interconnected.[139][140][141]
        Urbanization and fragmentation of habitats increasingly lead to loss of connection between human and natural
        environment. Furthermore, immunological non-communicable diseases have become increasingly common in recent
        decades especially in urbanized communities.[142]

        There are so many conservation challenges when dealing with biodiversity loss that a joint effort needs to be
        made through public policies, economic solutions, monitoring and education by governments, NGOs,
        conservationists etc.[143] Incentives are required to protect species and conserve their natural habitat and
        disincentivize habitat loss and degradation (e.g. implementing sustainable development including targets of SDG
        15). Other ways to achieve this goal are enforcing laws that prevent poaching wildlife, protect species from
        overhunting and overfishing and keep the ecosystems they rely on intact and secure from species invasions and
        land use conversion.[144] Furthermore, conservation based models like the Global Safety Net are continuously
        being developed to consider the ecological connections that need to be addressed to effectively mitigate
        biodiversity loss.[145] According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
        Services (IPBES) action to protect biodiversity is very cost effective because it reduces the risk of pandemics
        due to pathogens from wildlife.[146]
        Conservationists and sustainable research scientists around the world have also developed systems-based
        approaches to help mitigate biodiversity loss. This methodology allows scientists to create contextual
        frameworks that consider the many nuances and linkages of environmental conservation like ecological footprints,
        planetary boundaries, ecological economics, etc.[147] Considering all the many ways in which the natural and
        human world intersect can help researchers understand the intricacies that lead to biodiversity loss and find
        patterns that can be applied to similar situations. One example of these type of frameworks is the triple bottom
        line, which has been adopted by many businesses and organizations to evaluate their impact and progress towards
        the marriage of social, environmental, and economic success.

        Earth's 25 terrestrial hot spots of biodiversity. These regions contain a number of plant and animal species and
        have been subjected to high levels of habitat destruction by human activity.
        There are many organizations devoted to the cause of prioritizing conservation efforts such as the Red List of
        Threatened Species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the
        United States Endangered Species Act. British environmental scientist Norman Myers and his colleagues have
        identified 25 terrestrial biodiversity hotspots that could serve as priorities for habitat protection.[149]
        Many governments in the world have conserved portions of their territories under the Convention on Biological
        Diversity (CBD), a multilateral treaty signed in 1992–3. The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, part of the CBD's
        Strategic Plan 2011–2020, were published in 2010.[150] Since 2010, approximately 164 countries have developed
        plans to reach their conservation targets, including the protection of 17 percent of terrestrial and inland
        waters and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas.[citation needed]
        In 2019 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an
        international organization formed to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
        (IPCC),[151] published the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services which said that up to
        a million plant and animal species are facing extinction because of human activities.[144][21] An October 2020
        report by IPBES stated that the same human activities which are the underlying drivers of climate change and
        biodiversity loss, such as the destruction of wildlife and wild habitats, are also the same drivers of
        pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.[152] In 2022, IPBES listed some of the primary drivers of the
        contemporary extinction crisis as being unsustainable fishing, hunting and logging.[153]
        According to the 2020 United Nations' Global Biodiversity Outlook report, of the 20 biodiversity goals laid out
        by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, only 6 were "partially achieved" by the deadline of 2020.[154] The
        report highlighted that if the status quo is not changed, biodiversity will continue to decline due to
        "currently unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, population growth and technological
        developments".[155] The report also singled out Australia, Brazil and Cameroon and the Galapagos Islands
        (Ecuador) for having had one of its animals lost to extinction in the past 10 years.[156] Following this, the
        leaders of 64 nations and the European Union pledged to halt environmental degradation and restore the natural
        world. Leaders from some of the world's biggest polluters, namely China, India, Russia, Brazil and the United
        States, were not among them.[157] Some experts contend that the refusal of the United States to ratify the
        Convention on Biological Diversity is harming global efforts to halt the extinction crisis.[158] Top scientists
        say that even if the 2010 targets had been met, it likely would not have resulted in any substantive reductions
        of current extinction rates.[23][1] Others have raised concerns that the Convention on Biological Diversity does
        not go far enough, and argue the goal should be zero extinctions by 2050, along with cutting the impact of
        unsustainable food production on nature by half. That the targets are not legally binding has also been subject
        to criticism.[159]
        In 2020, with passing of the 2020 target date for the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, scientists proposed a
        measurable, near-term biodiversity target – comparable to the below 2 °C global warming target – of keeping
        described species extinctions to well below 20 per year over the next 100 years across all major groups (fungi,
        plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates) and across all ecosystem types (marine, freshwater, and

        A 2021 collaborative report by scientists from the IPBES and the IPCC says that biodiversity loss and climate
        change must be addressed simultaneously, as they are inexorably linked and have similar effects on human
        well-being. Pamela McElwee, human ecologist and co-author of the report, says "climate has simply gotten more
        attention because people are increasingly feeling it in their own lives – whether it's wildfires or hurricane
        risk. Our report points out that biodiversity loss has that similar effect on human wellbeing."
